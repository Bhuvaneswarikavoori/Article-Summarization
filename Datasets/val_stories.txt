(CNN) -- A Miami man who shot and killed his wife during a fight at their home in August and allegedly uploaded a picture of her corpse to his Facebook page told police he was defending himself, officials said.

"I'm not a killer," Derek Medina said in an August video released Friday by prosecutors. "I do not feel that I'm guilty and I feel like this was self-defense."

Medina, who has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, said he and his wife, Jennifer Alonso, were having an argument in the bedroom when "she started throwing stuff, objects, towards me," such as towels, mascara, creams, boxes and shoes.

"Anything in the room she could throw at me," said Medina, who told police he had been an amateur boxer with a 25-0 record. " ....I got hit in the face a few times."

Medina gave these additional details, as outlined in a Miami-Dade Police Department transcript accompanying the video:

At one point, he pulled a gun on his wife and told her to stop. After further discussion, he put the gun away and Alonso told him she was leaving him. They talked again downstairs, where she unloaded a volley of punches on him. He fetched the gun again. She pulled a knife. He wrestled it out of her hands and put it in a drawer.

Why people share murder, rape on Facebook

"She just started throwing punches like crazy. She was like really attacking me," he told police. "Like I was getting out of the way and got hit in the arm and she was like going for my temple."

Medina told police that Alonso threatend to kill him with a knife, but he disarmed her. He told police Alonso also said she would have someone kill him. Medina said as the fight continued, he shot his wife "six to eight times."

Medina told police he suffered injuries from his wife's pushing and punching.

According to authorities, Medina wrote on Facebook, "Im going to prison or death sentence for killing my wife love you guys miss you guys take care Facebook people you will see me in the news."

The gruesome image of Alonso stayed online and was passed along for at least five hours. Facebook was notified of the content and employees removed the picture and disabled the pages of Medina and his slain wife.

An autopsy report released on Thursday said Alonso suffered gunshot wounds to her left forearm. Some of the bullets traveled at a downward angle, with one bullet entering her right chin, lodging in her back at the right side of her ribs.

Gunpowder residue was found on her left hand and forearm, and the right side of her neck and chin. Seven bullets and two bullet fragments were recovered.

(CNN) -- He is in that landing pattern that middle-aged heartthrobs finally come to: time for home and family and a woman who is worthy of keeping his love.

The 50-plus Oscar winner, producer and political activist George Clooney is apparently engaged to be married. He's at a particularly pivotal age. Forget about the 50s being the new 40s -- the 50s are really very specific. Even the most youthful people will start thinking about the meaning of life as the years no longer stretch out in a fantasy of infinity. Those years between 50 and 60 do seem to be a particularly poignant age for men, especially the kind of man who has trouble giving up motorcycles.

Sometime in this period, the thrill seekers and lust lovers get their whiff of mortality (perhaps because of their latest motorcycle accident) and they turn to love with a new sense of its gravitas. With a nod to the motivation most of us mortals have, they are ready for an emotional legacy. (Hint: watch for children)

It might irk Clooney to be seen as so predictable. He's a gifted, idiosyncratic, goes-his-own-way, irreverent kind of guy. But he has been practicing for this life transition in full view. In his films, he has played lost middle-aged men, lost in their careers, lost in neglected marriages, lost because of a lack of connection to something important -- "Up in the Air," "The Descendents," "Michael Clayton," among others. Many of these men reshuffle their lives, readjust their principles or at least find some self knowledge they sorely lacked.

What we know about Amal Alamuddin

If the reports of his engagement are true, this is kind of what Clooney has done, and what a lot of professionally single men ultimately come to do, especially about love. His apparent fiancee, Amal Alamuddin, is an accomplished and wordly lawyer. Clooney's doing that middle-aged love choice. He's picking a woman of substance as well as beauty -- the kind of woman you would want as friend and counselor, the kind of woman who would have the genes to be the mother of your children -- and it's now, because it suddenly dawns on you that you have no time to lose.

In this scenario of the chastened older Lothario, the candidate is young enough to lust after and smart enough for impregnation. It's not that women, especially stars, don't come to the same point as Clooney and end up in the same position. But biology forces them to make the comparable choice at least a decade or so earlier. Unlike a woman his age, Clooney can do the whole settling-down gambit at almost any age. But he probably understood some ages are better for this than others.

I know this isn't very romantic, but the timing is -- whether the 50-something group knows it or not -- guided by the Grim Reaper. If that sounds bad, it's not.

Middle age is an important time for reassessment and course correction. No matter how bright your star, you know that only so much time is left to have a profound relationship and, perhaps, a family. This is the real anchor of middle-aged love: It's time to stop fooling around.
Hoylake (CNN) -- Rory McIlroy had won two majors before Sunday, but none in front of his dear old mum.

No wonder then that Rosie and her 25-year-old sank into tears as he walked off the 18th green at Hoylake as the new British Open champion.

A third major title of his fledgling career means the Northern Irishman is just a green jacket away from a career grand slam.

But McIlroy's mum is just relieved the jinx she perceived to be preventing him from winning one in front of her evaporated in a blanket of cloud on Merseyside.

"There was high emotion on the 18th, there really was," McIlroy told CNN from Hoylake's clubhouse, as jubilant members in the adjacent room chanted his name.

"My mum, she hadn't been to the previous two majors that I won, and it was incredible the first person that greeted me coming off the 18th was her.

"It was really a nice moment, she was crying her eyes out and I was trying to hold back the tears -- I think a few tears definitely came out.

Special moment

"It was a very special moment and to be able to share these moments with your parents -- especially parents like I have -- they're two of my best friends.

"I can talk to them about anything. They've been there for me through thick and thin and its great to share these moments with them."

McIlroy's Open victory was markedly different to his previous two major wins.

In the 2011 U.S. Open at Congressional and the following year's U.S. PGA Championship at Kiawah Island he eviscerated the field, winning both by a scarcely believable margin of eight shots.

At Hoylake he had to graft.

Leading by six shots prior to the final round he saw that shaved down to just two with a handful of holes left as Spain's Sergio Garcia, a friend and Ryder Cup buddy, hounded him doggedly.

But his links game, tweaked and perfected on the courses of his native Northern Ireland in the weeks leading up to the tournament, remained steadfast.

Despite shooting the worst score of any of the top 13 players on the final day, that cushion he'd compiled over previous days smoothed his way to glory.

Top honor

So how does this one rank?

"Winning The Open, the home major for guys like myself, it's a very special championship and I'm so very honored to have won it," he explained.

"I think every major win is different. Congressional was maybe silencing some of the doubters or battling some of the demons I had in my own head.

"Kiawah was coming off a bit of a slump in form but still having a good year. It was almost, not expected, but I felt like in 2012 the only thing I really needed was to win a major and I did.

"Again this feels a bit more like the first one at Congressional where I maybe had to silence a few doubters about how I played links golf, how can I handle a lead, how do I play well on a Friday.

"It's been a difficult 18 months at times since the start of 2013 and obviously winning the Claret Jug makes it all worthwhile."

By landing the Claret Jug, into which McIlroy revealed some top quality red wine might go, he has three of the four major titles on offer.

Masters aim

The one that continues to evade him is the U.S Masters, a tournament that evokes harrowing memories.

In 2011, as a 21-year-old, McIlroy led by four shots going into the final round, and disintegrated on the back nine, eventually finishing in a tie for 15th.

But he'll return to Augusta with three pillars of a slam completed, and the chance to become the first European ever to clinch one.

At just 25, McIlroy has years ahead of him to secure entry into elite band of six who have won all four majors.

But he's aiming to do it at the first attempt.

"I'd love to, especially going to Augusta now with three legs of the career grand slam under my belt and only having the green jacket to win," he said.

"I'll be going with a lot of motivation, I'll do everything I can to prepare the best way I can because it'll be a great chance for me to put that little milestone in my career to bed and go forward.

PGA Champs next

"Before that there's still the PGA Championship to play at Valhalla and I want to try to do my best there but going to Augusta next April is going to be a lot of fun."

That his Open triumph came at Hoylake, in front of passionate and enthusiastic fans from Merseyside and those who had traveled across from Ireland, was fitting.

He lost in the opening round of the boys championship in 2003 but retained an affinity for these links that are tightly wedged into a small corner of the Wirral Peninsula.

It is an affinity that will last a lifetime after this week.

"That boys championship was 2003 -- a lot can happen in 11 years that's for sure," he said. "I really enjoyed the course then.

"When I came back here a couple of weeks ago I couldn't remember all of the course -- obviously it looked much different with the grandstands and everything.

"It's a great golf course, a very fair golf course I feel, and if you play well you are rewarded. If you don't hit it so well you can put yourself in spots that make it very difficult for yourself.

"Hoylake is a course that I obviously love now but even when I got here a couple of weeks ago it was a course I felt I could do well on."

Decline reversed

McIlroy's British Open career had been in decline before this triumph.

After winning the low amateur medal in 2007, he finished third at St Andrew's in 2010. He led after the opening round and shot 80 the following day before steadying over the weekend.

The following year at Royal St George's he struck an stroppy note when claiming the oldest major was too reliant on weather conditions and that he wasn't prepared to change his game "for one week a year."

In 2012 he finished 60th and last year at Muirfield he didn't even make the cut, a moment he acknowledged as one of his lowest in recent times at his winner's press conference.

But a period of practice on links courses and in links conditions back in Northern Ireland prior to landing at Liverpool have recalibrated his game in triumphant fashion.

"I think you need experiences like the one in 2010, having the first round lead and losing it," he said.

Lesson learned

"OK, I came back and finished third but you need experiences like that to move forward and to learn from.

"I definitely learned a lot from that day in 2010 just as I learned a lot from my day at Augusta in 2011, having a four-shot lead going into the final day and ultimately losing out, having a very bad back nine.

"Did I feel like I could do it this year? I did. I felt like my game was in good shape. I had the win earlier in the year at Wentworth and I felt like my game was just coming into form.

"I just needed something to click and luckily everything clicked this week."
Washington (CNN) -- In the most extensive reshaping of the Obama administration's national security team to date, the president will name Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta as his nominee to succeed Robert Gates as defense secretary, top U.S. officials said Wednesday.

Gen. David Petraeus will be nominated to take over as CIA director, and Lt. Gen. John Allen will succeed Petraeus as head of the U.S-led international military force in Afghanistan, a senior administration official told reporters. In addition, longtime diplomat Ryan Crocker will be nominated as the next U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, the official said.

President Barack Obama will formally announce the changes on Thursday, according to the senior administration official. It is the biggest reshaping of Obama's national security team since he took office in January 2009 and reflects a longstanding plan by Gates to step aside this year.

More changes also are coming. Both Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and FBI Director Robert Mueller are not eligible for renomination for terms that expire this year.

Gates will resign effective June 30, assuming Panetta gets confirmed by Congress in time and is ready to start on July 1, according to an administration official and a congressional aide familiar with phone calls Gates was making to legislators and senior staff members.

Petraeus will remain in command in Afghanistan until Allen is ready to take over at the beginning of September, officials said, which could require an interim CIA director if Panetta moves to the defense secretary's office as planned on July 1.

In addition, Petraeus will resign from the military once confirmed so that he serves as a civilian CIA director, officials said.

Initial reaction from Congress was positive, with key legislators on intelligence and security issues praising both Panetta and Petraeus as good choices.

"The sum total of these picks is that the president has chosen experienced people with unique capabilities to serve our nation at a dangerous time," said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. "This team will provide the leadership to help make our nation safer. I could not be more pleased with these selections. I hope these nominees receive swift approval by the United States Senate."

Gates was telling legislators and staff members that he recommended Panetta for his job six months ago, and joked that Panetta stopped speaking to him for days for doing so, the officials said. In addition, Gates was saying that Allen was a consensus choice to succeed Petraeus, according to the officials.

It took a meeting with Obama to convince Panetta to accept the job, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. Panetta has been happy serving at the CIA, but "believes strongly in public service and answering the call from the commander-in-chief," the source said.

Panetta, 72, took over at the CIA in February 2009. He served as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton between 1994 and 1997, and was previously the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The California Democrat served in the House of Representatives from 1977 to 1993.

Before coming to the CIA, he spent 10 years co-directing a public policy institute with his wife, Sylvia.

He was brought in as a relative outsider, without hands-on intelligence experience, to manage an agency that had been shaken by the exposure and criticism of its controversial interrogation and detention program. Panetta's longstanding ties to Congress were seen as a way to restore the administration's relationship with oversight committees. He has been given high marks on both fronts from inside the agency and in Congress.

David Berteau, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Panetta brings several important qualities to the table.

He "learned a lot of lessons" about defense budgeting during his stint as the head of the OMB, and knows how to deal with a Republican Congress, as he did during the Clinton administration, Berteau said.

Panetta's former congressional district in northern California had a huge defense presence, Berteau said.

Panetta has earned the trust and confidence of Obama as leader of the CIA, and has name recognition, which is important, Berteau said, adding: "It's a name Americans recognize. Filling Bob Gates' shoes is really going to be a tough job."

Berteau said the president's choice of Petraeus to lead the CIA indicates that Obama is interested in his national security views and efforts and it "indicates that the president cares about the way all those pieces fit together."

Earlier this month, Petraeus took a highly unusual step for a military officer when he publicly acknowledged the possibility of being in contention for a presidential appointment.

"It's probably not appropriate for me to comment on whatever might be considered down the road," he told reporters in Kabul when asked about the possible CIA nomination. "I've had discussions, but again, it wouldn't be appropriate to comment."

Petraeus, 58, assumed command of the NATO International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and U.S. Forces Afghanistan on July 4, 2010, after serving for more than 20 months as commander of United States Central Command. He previously commanded multi-national forces in Iraq, leading the so-called "surge." During his time commanding the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center and Fort Leavenworth, he oversaw the development of the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual.

Crocker has served previously as U.S. ambassador to Iraq and to Pakistan, while Allen became deputy commander of U.S. Central Command in July 2008.

Gates is the only Cabinet member from the previous administration to stay on when Obama came into office. President George W. Bush nominated Gates as the nation's 22nd secretary of defense in December 2006 to replace Donald Rumsfeld, one of the architects of the Iraq War who was facing widespread criticism.

Gates did not expect to stay on after Bush's presidency ended. When asked if he would continue under another administration, Gates said in 2008, "I learned a long time ago never to say never, so my answer is: The circumstances under which I would do that are inconceivable to me."

But those circumstances arose. In December 2008, then-President-elect Obama expressed a desire for continuity at the Pentagon, given the ongoing conflicts abroad in Iraq and Afghanistan.

"I spent a long time hoping the question would never be popped," Gates admitted the day after Obama announced his nomination. But, he said, Obama "impressed" him.

It is unclear who may replace Mueller at the FBI.

Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday did not rule out Mueller staying on short-term when his 10-year term expires in September if a successor has not yet been confirmed. Mueller will leave "hard shoes to fill," Holder said.

Holder said he has been discussing potential nominees with White House officials, including Vice President Joe Biden. Holder said he believes that if a nominee is selected by May, the administration should have time to get the new director confirmed by August.

If that timeline slips, however, the Mueller term would end September 4, one week before the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Mueller has often remarked that he barely had a chance to find his desk before the 9/11 attacks occurred, and his entire decade was dominated by the fight against al Qaeda and its scattered supporters at home and abroad.

(CNN) -- R. Sargent Shriver, who was responsible for launching the U.S. Peace Corps after marrying into the Kennedy family and joining John F. Kennedy's White House, has died, according to his family.

Shriver, whose full name was Robert Sargent Shriver Jr., was 95. He had suffered for years from Alzheimer's disease.

The family released a statement, saying Shriver died Tuesday "surrounded by his five children, five children in-law, and his 19 grandchildren."

"He lived to make the world a more joyful, faithful, and compassionate place," the family's statement said. "He worked on stages both large and small but in the end, he will be best known for his love of others. No one ever came into his presence without feeling his passion and his enthusiasm for them."

President Barack Obama said he was "deeply saddened" over the death of Shriver, whom he called "one of the brightest lights of the greatest generation."

"Of his many enduring contributions, he will perhaps best be remembered as the founding director of the Peace Corps, helping make it possible for generations of Americans to serve as ambassadors of goodwill abroad," Obama said. "His loss will be felt in all of the communities around the world that have been touched by Peace Corps volunteers over the past half century and all of the lives that have been made better by his efforts to address inequality and injustice here at home."

After overseeing the Peace Corps launch in the early 1960s, Shriver went on to serve subsequent presidential administrations and kept up his activism throughout his life, becoming a chief architect of President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty and later heading the Special Olympics, which was founded by his wife, Eunice Kennedy Shriver.

Shriver's entree into the Kennedy family was Joseph P. Kennedy, the family patriarch, who hired him to run a business venture in Chicago. According to the Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives, the work led to an introduction to Eunice Kennedy, whose siblings included JFK, Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy.

Shriver and Eunice Kennedy married in 1953.

Shriver served as JFK's Midwest campaign manager for his 1960 presidential bid before heading the Peace Corps' launch, which was seen as part of a new approach to the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.

"He told me that everyone in Washington seemed to think that the Peace Corps was going to be the biggest fiasco in history," Shriver told Time magazine in 1963 of Kennedy's request that he head the program, "and it would be much easier to fire a relative than a friend."

In 2011, the Peace Corps is celebrating its 50th anniversary. More than 200,000 volunteers have served in 139 counties on issues ranging from education to public health to environmental preservation through the program, according to the Peace Corps' website.

The Peace Corps Tuesday mourned the loss "of our founder, friend and guiding light."

The Special Olympics, in a statement, said Shriver was an "advocate for the poor and powerless, and he compiled an unparalleled record of public service at every tier, from the local level to the world community."

After John F. Kennedy, his brother-in-law, was assassinated in 1963, Shriver was tapped by Johnson to launch the White House Office of Economic Opportunity, which comprised a handful of anti-poverty programs.

In a series of maneuvers that spoke to Shriver's penchant for working across the political aisle, he served as Republican President Richard Nixon's ambassador to France before becoming Democrat George McGovern's running mate in 1972, as the two unsuccessfully tried to unseat Nixon.

McGovern named Shriver as his running mate after his first choice, Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, stepped down after revealing he'd had psychiatric treatment that included electroshock therapy.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Shriver served as chairman of the board of Special Olympics International, which Eunice Kennedy Shriver founded in 1968. The organization sponsors sports training and events around the world for people with intellectual disabilities.

Shriver, who was born in Westminster, Maryland, in 1915 and who graduated from Yale, also was long active in the Roman Catholic Church.

President Bill Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1994.

"We are greatly saddened by the passing of Sargent Shriver. He leaves behind an astonishing legacy of people helped, lives transformed, and communities improved," the former president and his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said in a statement.  "Through his work and his passion, he helped build a better America and a more humane world. And he did it with boundless enthusiasm, infectious joy, and the deepest love for his family, his nation, and his work."

Eunice Kennedy Shriver died in 2009.

The Shrivers had five children including Maria Shriver, the media personality and former first lady of California; and Timothy P. Shriver, who now heads Special Olympics International.

Maria Shriver's husband, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, said his father-in-law's life "is a blueprint for those of us who aspire to place the needs of others above our own."

(CNN) -- Fresh accusations that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons in the ongoing civil war have led many to renew calls for the world to take stronger actions to stop the growing humanitarian crisis.

But recent polls have shown Americans are very reluctant to support military interventions in Syria. In a Huffington Post/YouGov poll, as few as 5% of respondents were willing to commit troops to the cause.

The Obama administration has been similarly hesitant to get involved in Syria.

Q&A: Is Syrian war escalating to wider conflict?

While the administration has made some efforts to respond to humanitarian crises elsewhere in the world -- the U.S. joined NATO in its successful mission to assist Libyan rebels, military advisers have been sent to Uganda to combat the Lord's Resistance Army and to Jordan to help Syrian rebels -- full-scale military intervention in Syria does not appear to be on the table.

President Obama's varying view on humanitarian intervention is in keeping with over 20 years of inconsistent American policy on the issue.

Over the last 20 years, the U.S. government has chosen to intervene in Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Haiti, and Libya while resisting calls to take action in Rwanda and Sudan.

Read more: 5 reasons Syria's war suddenly looks more dangerous

To better predict whether the U.S. will intervene in Syria, or any other similar crisis, we must understand why Washington selectively engages in humanitarian intervention missions.

Our recent research on when and why the U.S. engages in humanitarian intervention emphasizes two factors that might force the U.S. government's hand on humanitarian intervention: public opinion and Congressional partisanship. We analyzed public opinion polls and congressional votes during four episodes of humanitarian intervention -- Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo -- and found, as recent debates seems to suggest, humanitarian intervention is mired in the mundane world of politics. Contrary to conventional wisdom, politics do not end at "water's edge."

There is some good news to report: both the general public and individual legislators understand and are responsive to the moral imperative of stopping humanitarian crises.

The public is generally supportive of humanitarian missions. Even in the recent polls on Syria, respondents believe something should be done, even if they are unsupportive of military action by the U.S..

Opinion: Give peace talks in Syria a chance

Further, Congress is not wholly unresponsive to public preferences regarding intervention in humanitarian emergencies. Legislative support is more likely in cases where public opinion generally favors intervention.

Those who push for more humanitarian missions can increase support for such missions by raising public outcry for action.

But the bad news is that humanitarian crises, like in Syria, which should rise above politics as usual, are often mired in that very spot.

Opinion: Why the Syrian quagmire threatens Turkey

Although public opinion appears to have an influence on legislative behavior, traditional factors such as partisanship have the strongest influence on how legislators cast their votes.

Humanitarian intervention is most likely when the U.S. president enjoys a majority in Congress. In the case of the 1990s, humanitarian interventions failed to get off the ground when President Clinton lost majorities in Congress.

If American politics is becoming increasingly partisan, future administrations should have an even harder time galvanizing the domestic support they need to address any humanitarian crises.

Opinion: Obama's no-win options in Syria

This does not mean, however, that humanitarian intervention will only occur when a president enjoys a majority in Congress. As the recently launched humanitarian missions suggest, politicians are learning the lessons of the 1990s and circumventing Congress.

This helps explain why President Obama's decision to contribute the U.S. military to NATO operations in Libya proceeded without Congressional authorization; the president was surely aware that such a vote would go down to defeat in a Republican-controlled House and deeply partisan Senate.

Congress was similarly bypassed in October 2011 when the administration deployed military advisers to Uganda.

Congress was similarly bypassed in 2011 and 2013 when the administration deployed military advisers to Uganda and Jordan, respectively.

For those who advocate for a strong humanitarian intervention in Syria, our research does not paint a completely gloomy picture. Instead, it simply suggests that domestic political will is a necessary precondition for intervention missions and should not be overlooked.

It is important to recognize that partisan bickering and political jockeying shape responses to humanitarian crises just as in trade policy, arms control, and immigration politics. While the atrocities are singular in their importance, the politics of dealing with them are not.

For those eager to craft a uniform and effective international response to humanitarian crises as in Syria, they must first turn their attention to domestic politics.

The political elites who must decide when, whether, where and how to fulfill the responsibility to protect, face their own domestic political battles. Ignoring these contexts threatens to over-simplify both the problems and the promises of humanitarian intervention.

The mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv underwent emergency surgery after being shot in the back, city officials and police said Monday, amid continuing unrest in the region.

The attack on Mayor Gennady Kernes happened around noon local time, the Kharkiv city office official website said. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the shooting.

After a two-hour operation, Kernes was out of surgery but in critical condition, the city office said.

"The surgery was successful. His life-threatening condition is expected to go on for several days," a statement said. "He was unconscious when brought to the hospital."

The online statement also said a bullet casing was found at the scene.

Police said an investigation unit was trying to determine the circumstances of the shooting.

In a major challenge to Kiev's new leaders, armed rebels have captured towns and government buildings across eastern Ukraine and are holding a team of European monitors hostage.

Western nations accuse Moscow of supporting the separatist gunmen who are occupying official buildings in cities across the region.

Sanctions

The United States on Monday imposed sanctions against seven Russian government officials and 17 companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin in its latest action to punish Moscow for its actions in Ukraine.

The White House said the seven Russians, including two from Putin's inner circle, are now subject to a freeze on any assets they hold in the United States and a ban on U.S. travel.

In addition, the United States will deny export license applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities. The Commerce and State departments will revoke any existing export licenses that meet these conditions, the White House said in a statement.

"The sanctions build on the ones that were already in place. We're moving forward with an expanded list of individuals," U.S. President Barack Obama earlier told reporters in Manila, Philippines.

The move, Obama said, was to spur Putin to "walk the walk, not just talk the talk" in resolving the crisis in Ukraine.

If the latest round of sanctions does not work, the next phase could target economic sectors like banking, Obama said.

The European Union also announced Monday that it was imposing sanctions on 15 people who are "responsible for actions which undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine." A list of the people targeted by the latest sanctions will be published Tuesday and will go into effect at the same time, the Council of the European Union said. The sanctions will include asset freezes and travel bans.

U.S. and Russian defense secretaries speak

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke on the phone with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Monday.

According to a Pentagon description of their conversation, Shoigu "reiterated his assurance that Russian forces would not invade Ukraine." Hagel, the Pengaton said, called for an end to what he described as "Russia's destabilizing influence inside Ukraine" and "warned that continued aggression would further isolate Russia and result in more diplomatic and economic pressure."

The Russian government's description of the call said Shoigu "definitively denied the groundless allegations of the presence of Russian sabotage and military intelligence groups on Ukrainian territory" and criticized what he called "anti-Russian hysteria recently unleashed in the Western press."

He also criticized what he said was an "unprecedented" increase in activity of U.S. and NATO troops in Eastern Europe near the Russian border, according to the Russian government's description of the call.

Ukrainian soldier killed

A homemade bomb exploded near Ukrainian soldiers who were in the eastern Donetsk region Monday, killing one and injuring another, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said.

The death came days after Ukrainian forces said they killed five pro-Russian militants in an operation to clear roadblocks near the city of Slavyansk last week. Police are investigating Monday's blast, the Defense Ministry said.

A CNN team covering a pro-Ukraine rally in Donetsk watched violence unfold Monday as pro-Russian separatists wielding batons beat demonstrators who said they wanted to see a united Ukraine.

Observer freed

Pro-Russian separatists holding a European military observer team in eastern Ukraine released one of the observers for medical reasons Sunday, shortly after parading them before cameras.

At least seven of the inspectors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe appeared at a news conference staged by Vyacheslav Ponomarev, the self-declared mayor of Slavyansk, who referred to them as "prisoners of war."

The freed observer was from Sweden and had been suffering from diabetes, Ponomarev spokeswoman Stella Khorosheva told CNN. Michael Bociurkiw, an OSCE spokesman in Kiev, called it "a welcome development."

The monitors were seized Friday outside Slavyansk, one of the flashpoints in the standoff between Ukraine's interim government and pro-Russian factions challenging its authority in the east. They said that although they have diplomatic status, they went along with Sunday's news conference because the mayor asked them to.

Germany strongly criticized the group's appearance before the media.

The "parading of OSCE observers and Ukrainian security forces as prisoners is abhorrent and a flagrant violation of their human dignity," Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a statement.

He added that Russia had a duty to "influence" the separatists so that the other members of the mission could be freed as soon as possible.

Putin has repeatedly criticized what he says is Kiev's use of force against Ukrainian civilians.
BURBANK, California (CNN) -- Laura Ling on Wednesday expressed the shock she and Euna Lee felt when former President Clinton showed up in Pyongyang, North Korea, to help secure the two journalists' release.

The families of Euna Lee, left, and Laura Ling greet them Wednesday in California.

"We feared at any moment that we could be sent to a hard labor camp, and then suddenly we were told we were going to a meeting," a tearful and emotional Ling said at a news conference Wednesday morning in California shortly after arriving by plane with Lee and Clinton.

She spoke minutes after the two women were reunited with their families at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank outside Los Angeles. They had been detained in North Korea since March.

North Korea pardoned Ling, 32, and Lee, 36, after Clinton's brief trip Tuesday to Pyongyang.

"We were taken to a location, and when we walked through the doors, we saw standing before us President Bill Clinton," Ling said, with Lee standing beside her.  Watch the emotional return at the airport »

"We were shocked, but we knew instantly in our hearts that the nightmare of our lives was finally coming to an end."

She expressed her and Lee's "deepest gratitude" to Clinton and his "wonderful, amazing" team.  Watch as Ling says, "We could feel your love" »

"The past 140 days have been the most difficult, heart-wrenching time of our lives," Ling said. "We are very grateful that we were granted amnesty by the government of North Korea, and we are so happy to be home."

She said that she and Lee are looking forward to spending "some quiet, private time" with their families. iReport.com: Share reaction to the freed journalists

Former Vice President Al Gore also spoke to the throngs of journalists at the news conference. He expressed his gratitude to Clinton and President Obama and his administration who "have been deeply involved in this humanitarian effort."  Watch Gore pay tribute to the people involved in the effort »

Lee and Ling are employed by Gore's California-based media company, Current TV. The women were arrested in March while reporting from the border between North Korea and China. In June, they were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor on charges of entering the country illegally to conduct a smear campaign.

On Wednesday morning, Lee bowed as she walked down the steps of the plane into a private hangar, and Ling raised her fists into the air. The women hugged their families, who were waiting at the bottom of the stairs. Lee's 4-year-old daughter, Hana, clung tightly to her tearful mother.  Watch as the women reunite with their families »

Clinton walked off the plane minutes later but did not address the crowd.

"I am very happy that after this long ordeal, Laura Ling and Euna Lee are now home and reunited with their loved ones," Clinton said in a statement.

"When their families, Vice President Gore and the White House asked that I undertake this humanitarian mission, I agreed. I share a deep sense of relief with Laura and Euna and their families that they are safely home."

Journalist Lisa Ling said she never gave up hope that she would see her sister again.

"We always maintained our hope and knew in our hearts that we would see Laura again; we just didn't know when," Lisa Ling said outside her home in Los Angeles, California. "We are just thrilled beyond words that the day has finally arrived."

She said her sister was looking forward to eating fresh fruit and food for the first time in four months, after many meals of rice that often contained rocks.

"I can tell she has gone through a lot," Ling said.

"My sister has an amazing, amazing spirit, and she's a little bit weak right now, so I think it's going take a little time for her to gather up her wits and be able to talk about what she experienced."

At the White House, Obama applauded the release of the two journalists, saying, "We are very pleased with the outcome."

Their release is a "source of happiness not only for the families but for the entire country," he said.  Watch as Obama says, "We are relieved" »

Obama also thanked the former president and Gore for their roles in winning the women's release.

"I think that not only is this White House ... extraordinarily happy, but all Americans should be grateful to both former President Clinton and Vice President Gore for their extraordinary work," he said.

Clinton made the trip to North Korea after the women's families asked him to travel there, a senior administration official said.

Doug Ling, Ling's father, earlier reacted to the news of his daughter's release outside his home in Carmichael, California, saying it was "one of the best days in my life."

"I figured, sooner or later, they'd be back," he said.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also expressed her relief that the two women were released. She spoke from Nairobi, Kenya, where she is taking part in a multination visit to Africa.

"I spoke to my husband on the airplane, and everything went well," she said. "It is just a good day to be able to see this happen."

In July, Ling and Lee spoke to their families and told them that the North Koreans were willing to grant them amnesty if a high-level envoy, such as former President Clinton, were willing to travel to Pyongyang, the administration official said on condition of anonymity.

North Korea said Clinton "expressed words of sincere apology to Kim Jong Il" for the journalists' actions, but the administration official said he knew nothing about an apology.

He said Clinton met for three hours and 15 minutes with the North Korean leader but said he did not know what issues were discussed. But he said Clinton's views on a verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula are well-known.

North Korea's state-run Korea Central News Agency said Clinton conveyed a message from Obama "expressing profound thanks for this and reflecting views on ways of improving the relations between the two countries."

But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said before the announced agreement that Clinton was not carrying any message from Obama.

Gibbs added the former president last spoke with Obama during a White House visit in March. He described Clinton's trip as a "solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans."

Clinton's mission came as the United States and its allies in the region are seeking to persuade North Korea to return to the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.

North Korea conducted its second nuclear bomb test in May and has held several missile tests since then. The United Nations has responded by increasing sanctions on the nation.

North Korea and the United States had no regular contacts before a 1994 crisis over Pyongyang's nuclear program. North Korea agreed then to halt the development of nuclear weapons but abandoned that accord and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003.

Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000, near the end of his second term as president. His secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, had gone to Pyongyang in 2000 to meet with Kim. She was the last high-ranking American official to do so before this week.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- As Markus Winkelhock took to the sodden track of last week's European Grand Prix in Nuerburgring he went where one Winkelhock had been before, his father Manfred Winkelhock.

Nico Rosberg (left) gets a pep talk from his world championship-winning father at this year's Monaco Grand Prix

Winkelhock junior's first grand prix -- and possibly last for some time, now that Christijan Albers' vacated Spyker seat has gone to Sakon Yamamoto -- will be talked about for years to come. His decision to run on extreme wet tires on lap three saw him leading the race by 33 seconds before the race was suspended for the second time. And, although his race ended with hydraulic failure, and future drives in Formula 1 are by no means certain, he joins the rare club of drivers who have led a grand prix on their first race.

It was at Nuerburgring that his father Manfred Winkelhock raced his last Formula 1 grand prix. Never a contender -- he scored only two points from 47 starts -- he was nevertheless a popular driver with the home crowd. Sadly, eleven days after the 1985 German Grand Prix at Nuerburgring, Winkelhock was killed driving a Porsche 956 at a World Sportscar event in Mosport Park, Canada.

Manfred's brothers Joachim and Thomas Winkelhock were also racing drivers; Joachim entered seven grands prix in the 1989 season but did not pre-qualify, so didn't race.

"My father did his last F1 race at the Nuerburgring and now I'm doing my first," said Markus last Sunday, "that is something special."

Underneath his Spyker overalls, Markus wore a chain around his neck, as he always does when racing. On it was the wedding ring belonging to the father who died when Markus when only five years old -- a good luck talisman given to him by his mother.

Formula 1's history has many such tales of sons following fathers into racing careers -- and in some cases the second generation drivers lost their fathers at an early age. Fatalities have been so rare in F1 in the last two decades that it's easy to forget quite how dangerous an activity it once was.

Canadian Jacques Villeneuve had celebrated his eleventh birthday a month before his father Gilles, the legendary Ferrari driver, died in practice before the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder. Such was his status in Canada, that his remains were returned to his homeland aboard a jet of the Canadian Air Force, on the request of the government.

Knowing the dangers inherent in the sport, Villeneuve junior entered F1 in 1996. He started his first race from pole position and just missed out on the top step of the podium to his Williams team-mate, Damon Hill. In his next season Villeneuve junior achieved what his father rightly should have done, he won the World Championship.

Hill too was the son of a racing legend. Graham Hill was champion in 1962 and 1968. With the dashing demeanor, and pencil moustache, of a World War 2 flying ace, he projected an image of the true sporting Brit. But, behind the scenes, he was a tempestuous man who could be both vain and reckless.

Graham Hill died in 1975, when Damon was 15. It is often assumed that the sons of famous drivers who follow their fathers into the sport are drifted into their seats on a wave of nepotism and inheritance. Not true of Damon, who had to work as a motorcycle courier in London to pay for his start in motor racing.

Graham Hill didn't die racing. He died trying to land a Piper Aztek airplane in fog. The plane was not properly registered or insured and Hill died along with his five passengers (including Tony Brise, who was racing for Hill's F1 team at the time). The families of the bereaved had no choice but to sue the estate of Graham Hill for compensation.

Another F1 champion to sire a racing son was American Mario Andretti. He won the 1978 world championship for Lotus and also having a successful career in the US oval circuits in both Champcar and NASCAR. His son Michael entered F1 in 1993, paired with Ayrton Senna at McLaren. But, despite his success in Champcar, Andretti junior failed to make an impression in Formula 1 and was replaced, after just 13 races, by Mika Hakkinen. He would be the last American to compete in F1 until the appearance of Scott Speed in 2006.

The current F1 grid contains one F1-sibling and one F1-offspring. Ralf Schumacher, of course, is brother to seven-times world Champion Michael (and living proof that driving talent isn't necessarily inherited). And Williams driver Nico Rosberg is the son of Keke Rosberg, the Finnish driver who won the world championship for Williams in 1982.

Three-time world champion Jack Brabham's son, David raced for Brabham and Simtek in 1990 and 1994 without ever scoring points. And two-time champion Emerson Fittipaldi's son Christian raced for three seasons in the early 1990s, scoring a total of 12 championship points.

Are there other sons-of-champions waiting in the wings? Tomas Scheckter, son of Jody Scheckter the 1979 world champion, tested for Jaguar in 2001 but was fired. He now races in the A1GP series and looks an unlikely F1 contender.

1992 world champion Nigel Mansell has supported the racing careers of sons Leo and Greg, who have both raced in single-seat racing formulae but, again, without looking obvious F1 contenders (though Greg is only 19). And four-time world champion Alain Prost's son Nicolas has had some success in the feeder formulae but, at 25, is considered old compared with young blood such as Robert Kubica and Sebastian Vettel.

Nelson Angelo Piquet, son of three-time championship winner, Nelson Piquet is a test driver for Renault. E-mail to a friend
(CNN) -- So, Gary Oldman, tell us what you really think.

In a raw interview with Playboy, the actor, 56, railed against Hollywood "dishonesty" and double standards, said that Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin have been victims of hypocrisy and asserted that not voting for "12 Years a Slave" to win an Oscar meant "you were a racist."

Oh, and he doesn't like the Golden Globes, helicopter parents or reality TV, either.

Indeed, the "Dark Knight" actor, who's starring in the forthcoming "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes," pulled no punches when talking about pretty much anything. The conversation will appear in the magazine's July/August issue.

The Gibson and Baldwin affairs really angered him, he said, because he believes their accusers don't exactly have clean hands themselves.

"I don't know about Mel. He got drunk and said a few things, but we've all said those things. We're all f***ing hypocrites," Oldman said. "The policeman who arrested him has never used the word 'n*****' or 'that f***ing Jew'? I'm being brutally honest here. It's the hypocrisy of it that drives me crazy.

"Mel Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews and he said the wrong thing because he's actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him -- and doesn't need to feed him anymore because he's got enough dough," Oldman continued. "But some Jewish guy in his office somewhere hasn't turned and said, 'That f***ing kraut' or 'F*** those Germans,' whatever it is? We all hide and try to be so politically correct. That's what gets me. It's just the sheer hypocrisy of everyone."

Other Oldman tidbits:

On reality TV: "The museum of social decay."

On helicopter parents: "There's never any unsupervised play to develop skills or learn about hierarchy in a group or how to share. The kids honestly believe they are the center of the f***ing universe. But then they get out into the real world and it's like, 'S**t, maybe it's not all about me,' and that leads to narcissism, depression and anxiety."

On political correctness at the Oscars: "At the Oscars, if you didn't vote for '12 Years a Slave' you were a racist. "

On the Golden Globes: "A meaningless event. ... It's 90 nobodies having a wank."

If Oldman is hard on Hollywood and its people, he's equally critical of himself. Asked about "Sid & Nancy," his breakthrough film, he said, "I don't like myself in the movie." Ditto with "The Fifth Element" and "The Dark Knight."

"It was work," he said. (He did have kind things to say about the film "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Francis Ford Coppola and "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" director Alfonso Cuaron.)

As the interview continued, Oldman -- who described his politics as "libertarian" -- recognized that he may have been a little too blunt.

"So this interview has gone very badly. You have to edit and cut half of what I've said, because it's going to make me sound like a bigot," he said at one point

"You're not a bigot?" replied interviewer David Hochman.

"No, but I'm defending all the wrong people," Oldman said. "I'm saying Mel's all right. Alec's a good guy. So how do I come across? Angry?"

"Passionate, certainly," Hochman said. "Readers will have to form their own opinions."

"It's dishonesty that frustrates me most," Oldman said. "I can't bear double standards. It gets under my skin more than anything."
In a daring operation worthy of a movie, three men escaped from a Canadian jail by helicopter, prompting a massive manhunt, authorities said.

The men escaped from a detention center Saturday night in Quebec City.

"A helicopter touched down briefly in the courtyard before taking off with the three prisoners,"  said Ann Mathieu, a spokeswoman for Quebec Provincial Police.

"We are talking closely with the detention center to figure out exactly how the escape transpired," Mathieu told CNN partner CBC. "The priority ... is to find the helicopter."

A manhunt is under way for Yves Denis Yvon Lamontagne, 35,  Denis Lefebvre, 53, and Serge Pomerleau, 49.

The first two men were arrested in a drug bust in 2010 and were awaiting trial. Police found weapons, dozens of cars and a plane during the bust, it said. There was no information provided on the third suspect.

It marks the second brazen jail escape in Canada in a little more than a year.

In March 2013, two men posing as tourists commandeered a helicopter from a Canadian tour company, ordered the pilot to fly over a detention center near Montreal, hoisted two inmates into the hovering aircraft using cables -- and zipped away.

It was a real "James Bond moment," witness Francis Emond said about last year's escape from the facility in Saint-Jerome, northwest of Montreal.

While spectacular, airborne escapes are not unprecedented.

Albanian inmate Alket Rizaj broke out of a maximum security prison in Greece twice -- in 2006 and 2009.

On both occasions, accomplices swooped in to the prison's courtyard on helicopters. Inmates then climbed aboard using rope ladders.

Both times, Rizaj was recaptured.

Last year, another prison escape in Greece tried to use the same tactic.

But the plot was foiled when the prisoner was shot and the chopper was forced to land on the prison parking lot.

In 1971, Joel David Kaplan escaped from a Mexican jail aboard a helicopter. The New Yorker's flight inspired the book "The 10-Second Jailbreak: The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan" and the 1975 movie "Breakout."

And in France, Pascal Payet escaped not once, not twice, but three times from French prisons.

Each time, he was recaptured.

Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- A series of recent fires in at least five detention centers around the country has raised questions about living conditions in Turkey's prison system.

Late Saturday night a fire broke out in the dormitory of a prison in the southeastern province of Sanliurfa. The fire claimed the lives of 13 prisoners and injured five others before authorities successfully extinguished the blaze.

Prisoners reportedly set fire to their mattresses to protest cramped and unsuitable living conditions.

A day after the first protest blaze was put out, prisoners in the same prison once again set fires in the dormitories, this time injuring 42, according to the semi-official Anatolian Agency.

The latest prison fire occurred Tuesday in the southern province of Karaman. There were no casualties but inmates had to be evacuated to the prison yard. On Monday, similar fires were reported at other detention facilities, including prisons in Gaziantep, Adana and Osmaniye.

"Overcrowding is the primary problem," said Ozturk Turkdogan, president of the Human Rights Foundation in Turkey, or IHD, pointing out that the Sanliurfa prison is equipped to house 375 prisoners but currently houses nearly 1,200. The cell where the fire started was furnished with six beds but housed 18 prisoners, according to an IHD report.

"When I was in the prison, at first we were six people in a six-person room, which was fine. But then, two by two they put more people in. Ultimately, we were 14 people living in the room," said Cemal Babaoglu, who spent three months in the prison last year awaiting trial.

Such overcrowding is not a new problem in Turkey, according to officials.

"This is a problem that evolves from the past (but is) getting smaller as (we) head into the future. The steps that we have taken in order to minimize and eventually eliminate the problem are evident," said Justice Minister Sadullah Ergin at a press conference on Tuesday.

Turkey is in the process of upgrading its prison system and will increase its capacity nearly twofold by 2017, according to officials.

The primary reason for overcrowding in Turkish prisons is a judicial system that errs on the side of detention rather than releasing the accused on bail before and during legal proceedings, and a new penal code that has lengthened prison sentences. According to the justice ministry, 27.5% of prisoners are detainees awaiting the outcome of their trials.

But Turkdogan maintains that 41% of all prisoners in Turkey are either awaiting trial or a decision from an appellate court, a situation made more problematic, he says, by the fact that over half of appealed convictions are eventually overturned.

According to Human Rights Watch researcher Emma Sinclair-Webb, it is not only the problem of overcrowding, which is present in many of the world's penal systems, but also the lack of transparency that prevents prison conditions in Turkey from conforming to accepted international standards.

"Human rights groups and (nongovernmental organizations) cannot visit prisons easily without lengthy procedures," said Sinclair-Webb. "Turkey lacks a regular system of independent monitors."

Experts who are in the best position to identify and prevent hazardous conditions are thus unable to make firsthand observations, reducing pressure that might otherwise accelerate improvements to basic necessities such as medical care and infrastructure.

"The capacity to respond to these complaints, to take measures to prevent the kind of tragedy that happened at the (Sanliurfa) prison, we are not seeing at the moment," said Sinclair-Webb.

Sanliurfa prison has been in the headlines before. After his requests for a transfer were denied, an inmate who lit himself on fire in protest of living conditions died in July 2010.
(CNN) -- Southern California residents flooded 911 centers Wednesday night with calls about a mysterious, fast-moving streak of light in the sky.

Was it a meteor?, they wondered.

The answer, according to meteorologists, is maybe.

The North American Aerospace Defense Command weather department says the streak of light that caused consternation from many most likely was part of a meteor shower.

"We've gotten numerous phone calls of people reporting seeing something brightâ€”consistent with a meteor shower---over the eastern desert communities of San Diego," said Lt.Michael Munsey of the San Diego Sheriff's Department.

There were sightings as far away as Arizona, Utah and Las Vegas, CNN affiliate KCBS reported. And someone even claimed on YouTube that he captured footage of the streak of light.

Matthew Isaacs, from Mission Viejo, said he was driving when he saw the flash of light.

"I saw this big, greenish flash like, light up the sky. It was headed pretty sideways from like, east to west. I thought, 'Is that a firework?' And then I realized, that couldn't be that big. It's just in the middle of nowhere in a totally dark area where there's no houses or anything where anyone would shoot fireworks. I thought, 'Man, it must have been a meteor,'" Isaacs told KCBS.

The light most likely came from the South Taurids meteor showers.

These meteors are generally the most visible in the first half of November, the American Meteor Society says.

The South Sudanese government and rebels signed a cease-fire deal on Thursday after more than a month of fighting, according to the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an East African trade bloc that has been helping to mediate between the parties.

The government and the rebels reached the agreement in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa.

It calls for an immediate end to all military operations and a freeze of forces at the "place they are in."

The parties also agreed not to attack civilians and to refrain from rape, sexual abuse and torture. Supply routes for humanitarian aid are to be opened to reach displaced populations.

The agreement also sets up an unarmed group of monitors that includes members from surrounding East African nations and representatives from both the rebels and the government.

Their job will be to ensure that the cease-fire agreement is effective.

According to the official document, the cease-fire begins Friday, 24 hours after its signing.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed hope that a peace deal will "provide good opportunities for South Sudanese, and the people around this country who have been suffering."

Support for peace talks also came from U.S. President Barack Obama who called on both parties to adhere to a separate detainee agreement, which was also signed as part of the cease-fire deal.

"The full participation of political detainees currently being held by the Government of South Sudan will be critical to those discussions, and we will continue to work to expedite their release," the White House statement said.

South Sudan erupted in violence on December 15 when rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar tried to stage a coup. Violence quickly spread, with reports of mass killings emerging nationwide.

Some of the heaviest fighting was over control of Bor, the strategically located capital of Jonglei state. It was recaptured by government forces last week. The mayor said between 1,200 and 1,400 civilians were killed when rebels held Bor between December 17 and 24.

In a statement, the trade bloc said the cease-fire is an important milestone, but more shuttle diplomacy is needed before the next phase of peace talks can begin.

South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war, making it the world's youngest nation.
(CNN)The Department of Homeland Security is increasing security checks at American airports because of concerns over new bomb-making instructions released by al Qaeda in Yemen (AQAP), the terrorist group which U.S. intelligence agencies believe may have been behind the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, U.S. officials tell CNN.

They say the new measures will feature additional random checks after passengers make it through security and will include passenger pat-downs, bag checks and hand swabs for traces of explosives.

The new issue of AQAP's Inspire magazine, released on December 24, featured instructions on how to build what AQAP called a "hidden bomb" from easily purchasable materials. It also included directions on how would-be lone wolves worldwide can evade airport security scanners and sniffer dogs.

In recent months, AQAP's leadership has repeatedly stated hitting the United States is a priority. The new issue of Inspire made clear it viewed lone wolf attacks by its supporters in the West as an increasingly important part of these efforts.

The magazine claimed the recipe was for a simplified version of the device used in an attempt to blow up a U.S. passenger jet over Detroit five years ago.

On Christmas Day 2009, Omar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called "underwear bomber," attempted to detonate an explosive device built by Ibrahim al Asiri, AQAP's master bomb-maker, on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. The main charge -- a white powdery explosive called PETN which airport security scanners at Amsterdam airport did not detect -- failed to detonate as the plane approached Detroit.

The new recipe does not involve the manufacture of PETN, a substance difficult for extremists to manufacture or obtain in the West. Instead, it contains similarities to a bomb formula put out by the group in the first issue of Inspire in 2010 called "Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom." That recipe was downloaded and used by the Boston bombers and several other extremists in plots on both sides of the Atlantic.

In the new issue, AQAP suggested its external operation division had greenlighted sharing the recipe because al Asiri and his team had developed a new generation of more sophisticated devices.

What is AQAP?

In 2012 Saudi and Western intelligence foiled a plot by AQAP to bomb a U.S. plane with an updated version of the underwear device.

It is not clear if the recipe is viable or if it would have enough explosive power to endanger an aircraft. Nor is it clear if the device would have any chance of getting through explosive scanners at airport security.

U.S. officials and explosive detection experts tell CNN that advanced detection equipment, including body scanners, should catch even previously hard-to-detect explosives like PETN, even if detection experts say they don't provide a 100% guarantee.  But U.S. officials say advanced body-scanning technology is not available in some smaller U.S. airports.

The authors of the latest issue of Inspire magazine claimed that if enough lone wolves launch attempts with their suggested device, some would get through.

The magazine stated that even if the devices were detected or malfunctioned they would bring terror to the West.

The key aim, the group stated, was to undermine the American economy. It listed several American airline companies, as well as British and French carriers as targets. It said that lone wolves should claim responsibility by writing emails timed to be distributed after their operations.

In the 112-page issue the group also mentioned recent lone wolf attackers in Canada, the United States, Australia and France, calling a hatchet attack on NYPD police officers in Queens in October "splendid."

Counterterrorism officials on both sides of the Atlantic been concerned about technical instruction provided by Inspire magazine for several years.

In August 2013 the British security agency MI5 revealed to the UK parliament's intelligence and security committee that "Inspire" has been "read by those involved in at least seven out of the 10 attacks planned within the UK since its first issue (in 2010). We judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these 10 attack plots."

Magazine story on bomb making prompts airport searches
(CNN) -- The mother of a 15-year-old girl who appeared on "The Tyra Show" as a self-described sex addict is suing the daytime talk show host for up to $3 million, claiming the show flew the girl, Jewel Ciera Washington, to New York and put her on TV without parental consent or the proper work papers required by the state of Georgia.

"It's like I'm trapped in a dark place with no light shining down, like I'm a prisoner," Washington said on the TV show. "I know that I need help for this. ... I know it for a fact," she added.

The lawsuit, filed October 8 in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Georgia, by Beverly McClendon, says written consent and an employment certificate must be obtained before a minor can be "employed as a performer in a television production ... [and] the minor will not be used for pornographic purposes."

According to McClendon's attorneys, Wanda Jackson and George Lawson, "the sole intent of the Defendants programming was to increase ratings in order to gain advertising revenue."

McClendon's attorneys claim "both Plaintiffs [McClendon and Washington] have been harmed and have received injury ... to their health and well-being " as a result of the alleged violations and alleged negligence by the TV show host and program, its executive producers and Warner Bros. Entertainment.

Washington appeared on the now-defunct program in October 2009.

Scott Rowe, senior vice president of worldwide communications for Warner Bros. Television Group, told CNN Entertainment that the company is "not commenting at this time." Calls to McClendon and her lawyers have not been returned.

(CNN) -- Uganda's President has declined to sign a bill that would punish certain homosexual acts with life in prison, but the move was not designed to protect the civil rights of gays and lesbians.

President Yoweri Museveni believes that parliament illegally passed the bill, and gays and lesbians are "sick people who need help," his spokesman said.

A Ugandan lawmaker first introduced the bill in 2009 with a death penalty clause for some homosexual acts. It was briefly shelved when Britain and other European nations threatened to withdraw aid to Uganda, which relies on millions of dollars from the international community.

The nation's parliament passed the bill last month, supplanting the death penalty provision with a proposal of life in prison for "aggravated homosexuality." It was awaiting the President's signature for passage.

News came Friday that the President had sent a letter to the speaker of the parliament, saying he can't sign the bill because there weren't enough parliament members present when it was passed.

"There was no quorum which (was) mandated for bill passage. Thus, he is unable to sign a bill that was not legally passed," spokesman Tamale Mirundi said.

The spokesman further explained Museveni's thinking about the issue.

"Homosexuals need help. They are sick," Mirundi said. "Homosexuals were present in Africa in the past and were not persecuted."

The President also believes that the issue is not a priority for his country.

"It might be important in Europe, but not here," Mirundi said. "The President's inability to sign the bill is very clear and his stance has not changed. ... There was no quorum, and homosexuals are sick people who need help."

According to Amnesty International, the bill's definition of "aggravated homosexuality" includes acts in which a person is infected with HIV, "serial offenders" and sex with minors.

The bill also proposed years in prison for anyone who counsels or reaches out to gays and lesbians, a provision that would ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists.

But lawmakers in the conservative nation sought tougher legislation, saying the influence of Western lifestyles risks destroying family units.

"This is a piece of legislation that is needed in this country to protect the traditional family here in Africa, and also protect the future of our children," said David Bahati, the lawmaker who introduced the bill.

Rights groups and the international community had urged Museveni to veto the bill.

Parliament is in recess and won't reconvene until February 18, parliament spokesman Moses Bwalatum said. The bill can become law without the President's signature if Museveni returns it to parliament twice and it garners the support of two-thirds of lawmakers, he said.

Well, it seems the U.S. Navy finally got the memo: DON'T USE ALL CAPS! IT'S RUDE!

The Navy is switching to a new messaging system that's cheaper and more efficient.

And oh yeah, one that does away with a century-old practice: communications using all uppercase letters.

"Lowercase messages are here to stay; they provide a more readable format," a Navy news release said, citing James McCarty, the naval messaging program manager at U.S. Fleet Cyber Command.

The all-caps were a vestige of a bygone era.

Back in the 1850s, the teletype machines that the military used were made up of three rows of keys -- none of them lowercase letters.

Word of the change went out to all naval commands in April. But it didn't reach the rest of us until the news release this week.

In it, the Navy said it is ditching its in-house Defense Message System in favor of e-mail. One with a very apt acronym: NICE (Navy Interface for Command Email).

The switch will save the Navy $20 million a year. And it gets them caught up with current Internet protocol.

ALL CAPS READS LIKE YOU'RE BEING SHOUTED AT.

Old sea dogs may feel differently. But they have a couple of months to adjust.

The system won't fully be in place until next year.

Once it is, naval officers will no longer feel like they're being barked at.

Except, of course, in person by their superiors.
Washington (CNN) -- Staff Sgt. Salvatore Giunta, the first living Medal of Honor recipient since the Vietnam War, is a new dad.

The Army soldier's mother told CNN Monday that Giunta, who has left the active-duty Army and begun studies in college, is the father of a baby girl.

Giunta married his wife Jennifer in 2009.

Giunta's mother, Rosemary, said the baby and mother are doing fine.

The girl was born last week, but the new grandmother said Giunta is keeping details like the baby's name and exact birth date private.

As the daughter of a Medal of Honor recipient, baby Giunta will get a few benefits herself.

She and the rest of her family will get special identification cards and commissary and exchange privileges. The latter affords them access to lower-cost shopping, as well as recreation facilities like pools and bowling allies.

And if she qualifies, baby Giunta will be eligible for admission to a United States military academy, without having first to be nominated or adhere to quota retirements.

Giunta was awarded the Medal of Honor in November for his deeds in a battle with the Taliban in Afghanistan in October 2007.

He continued fighting, and rescued a team leader, despite being hit twice by bullets -- one striking his armored vest and another that hit a weapon on his back. Neither caused serious injuries, and Giunta went back to work with his unit moments after the attack ended.

After having served two tours in Afghanistan over seven years, Giunta announced plans in February to leave the U.S. Army and move to Fort Collins, Colorado, with his wife, Lt. Col. Greg Hapgood of the Iowa National Guard said then.
The All Blacks and their fans are clear on one thing, says Dan Carter: the goal is to make history and become the first rugby nation to win back-to-back World Cups.

For many players, such lofty expectations could threaten to derail the whole mission.

Not so Carter, who is one of the game's true superstars.

"I absolutely love the pressure that not only the media and the public put on us, but also the pressure that we put on ourselves as a team," the world's all-time leading point-scorer told CNN.

On an ambassadorial visit to London, the New Zealander is taking a six-month break from the game as he seeks to revive his battered body for next year's title defense in England and Wales.

Next October's final will be at Twickenham, the headquarters of English rugby -- a place where the 32-year-old has endured both highs and lows in his career.

Winning in London

Heading abroad to another World Cup where the All Black are certain favorites -- following their steamrollering 14-game perfect year in 2013 -- Carter has every reason to be optimistic.

But any All Blacks fan knows better, having watched mystified as similarly all-conquering teams have failed to capture the trophy except for the two occasions the tournament has taken place on home turf -- and they had an agonizing 24-year gap between those successes.

Carter knows there are a host of teams now hoping to seize on any sign of All Black weakness: he lists his old Tri-Nations rivals Australia and South Africa, plus England, Ireland, Wales, and even Fiji as teams that could cause an upset.

But, he says, the year ahead is about being ready for the challenge.

"We had a great couple of years and the hype is starting to build in New Zealand -- especially as a player -- about the World Cup so it's going to be a challenging year in 2014."

Lifting the cup

Carter had the bittersweet pleasure of watching the All Blacks' triumph in Auckland in 2011 while sitting in the stand, having missed the majority of the tournament with a groin injury.

Stephen Donald, who kicked what was ultimately the winning penalty against France, was called up to the squad for the final due to injuries suffered by Carter's replacements.

"I've been part of the squad that's won the World Cup before so, you know, that's a huge achievement," Carter says, diplomatically.

This time he's hoping to get the jump on the injury problems, taking a sabbatical from the game after his most recent Achilles strain ahead of the international program, with the All Blacks' southern-hemisphere Rugby Championship title defense starting in August.

"Physically and mentally, I'm in a great space," he says.

Fighting ghosts

That Achilles injury came on the occasion of his 100th international cap -- a tense showdown with England at Twickenham in November 2013, where the All Blacks came out on top 30-22.

What should have been a milestone celebration for the No. 10 ended as he hobbled off the pitch with just 25 minutes played.

A year prior, at the same venue, England shocked New Zealand 38-21 to end the Kiwis' 20-match unbeaten run.

It was England's first win over the All Blacks at the "Cabbage Patch" since 2002 -- and Carter has plenty of previous better memories of the hallowed venue.

"I love playing at Twickenham. It's one of my favorite stadiums," he said.

"It's a real rugby environment, rugby culture is everything to do with Twickenham.

"You know -- I've had some great success there. Lost one game there a couple of years ago but apart from that I've had a lot of success at Twickenham."

Playing on

Carter is delighted that when he finally vacates the No. 10 shirt for good, there will be a stream of worthy successors.

"The beauty is, there's a lot of depth in my position and with the injuries that I've had in the last couple of years it's given the opportunity for a lot of young guys coming through," he said.

"There's Aaron Cruden, Beauden Barrett, Tom Taylor that have all had roles in the last year or two and every time they've had the opportunity, they've played extremely well."

But don't start looking for replacements just yet: Carter, who has scored 1,440 points for the All Blacks, says he'd love to keep playing for another four or five years "at least."

After the World Cup, he'll consider his future. It could mean a return to Europe, where he spent an injury-shortened spell with French club Perpignan in 2008-09 -- or even a move to Japan.

Until 2015 he'll be staying in New Zealand, and preparing for the challenge to come.

"The pinnacle of any rugby player is to reach those heights but to do it away from home, two tournaments in a row would be something pretty special," Carter said.

"I'll be working as hard as I can to try and be there if the All Blacks can reach that milestone."
A top European Union official said Saturday that new sanctions will be proposed within a week against Russia over its actions in Ukraine, but  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko sounded like he can't wait that long.

"I think we are very close to the point of no return," Poroshenko said Saturday following an EU summit in Brussels. "The point of no return is full-scale war, which already happened in the territory controlled by separatists and where -- instead of separatists -- there are regular Russian troops."

Poroshenko said the situation had worsened in the last few days and that thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.

Russia has repeatedly denied either supporting the rebels or sending its own troops over the border. But those assertions have been roundly rejected by the West.

European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, speaking at the summit, said new sanctions will be proposed.

"The European Council says that it stands ready to take further significant steps in the light of the evolution of the situation on the ground and it requests the commission to urgently undertake preparatory work ... and present proposals for consideration within a week," Rompuy said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared defiant in the face of a chorus of Western condemnation over what NATO says is clear evidence of Russian military aggression in Ukraine.

Moscow doesn't want or intend to wade into any "large-scale conflicts," Putin said Friday at a youth forum, state-run Itar-Tass reported. A few breaths later, he made the point that Russia is "strengthening our nuclear deterrence forces and our armed forces," making them more efficient and modernized.

"I want to remind you that Russia is one of the most powerful nuclear nations," the President said. "This is a reality, not just words."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President Barack Obama agreed in a phone call Thursday that they would have to consider tougher action against Russia.

The European Union and the United States have already slapped economic sanctions on targeted Russian individuals and businesses. The union also has sanctioned certain sectors of the Russian economy, prompting Russia to retaliate with its own measures.

Port city fortifies

The Ukrainian military worked to fortify the port city of Mariupol after Russian intelligence groups were observed there, Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Defense and Security Council, said Saturday.

A CNN team saw Ukrainian forces strengthening defensive positions on the eastern outskirts of the city, reinforcing checkpoints and digging trenches along roads leading toward the Russian border.

Beyond these checkpoints, the team found a small advance detachment of Ukrainian troops on the main road about halfway between Mariupol and Novoazovsk. The soldiers said it had been quiet Saturday.

The CNN team encountered the first pro-Russian rebel roadblock a short distance outside Novoazovsk, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the Russian border, with concrete blocks across the road and a heavy machine gun among the weaponry.

A 12.7 mm heavy machine gun was among the weapons at the roadblock. The fighters would not allow the CNN team to pass through but said they should "come back tomorrow."

There is a large stretch of territory east of Mariupol, some 15-30 kilometers wide depending on location, that is occupied by neither Ukrainian forces nor pro-Russian fighters.

In the villages between the two "front lines" there are no signs of damage. Some stores are open and there is some civilian traffic on the roads. Long queues have formed at one checkpoint out of Mariupol as people from rural areas try to get in and out of the city.

Denials 'without credibility'

Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in March, following the ouster of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych the previous month.

Violence broke out in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April, as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev. Since mid-April, the conflict between the pro-Russia rebels and the Ukrainian military has cost more than 2,500 lives, according to the United Nations.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday that -- whatever the Kremlin says -- the reality is Russian troops are inside Ukraine and have fired on Ukrainian military positions.

See the NATO satellite images

In response, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said NATO had previously used "images from computer games" to -- in his view -- falsely make the case that Russian troops are in Ukraine, and said the "latest accusations are pretty similar."
(CNN) -- Crews in Southern California struggled to get the upper hand on a fast-moving wildfire in Santa Barbara County early Tuesday.

Known as the White Fire, the blaze had already charred some 1,000 acres after getting its start Monday afternoon, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Andrew Madsen said. The flames were 5% contained.

The Forest Service expects to have 700 personnel in place Tuesday morning.

The Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department evacuated up to 6,000 people from the popular White Rock Campground at the end of the busy Memorial Day weekend as the wildfire advanced, public information officer Kelly Hoover said.

Although the fire caused minor damage to a ranger station, it quickly moved deeper into Los Padres National Forest, away from homes and structures, according to Madsen.

No injuries or fatalities have been reported.

Santa Barbara is located about 85 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
(CNN) -- At least 10 people were killed and more than 100 wounded following a pair of bombings Saturday in the southern Thai city of Yala, Thai media reported.

The two blasts were the result of bombs stashed in stolen trucks, Police Lt. Gen. Paitoon Chuchaiya told CNN affiliate MCOT.

Video from the scene showed damage to buildings, cars and motorcycles on the street.

The blasts set fires to nearby vehicles, including a van, which itself exploded, leading to initial reports of a third bomb, Chuchaiya said.

Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said she has been informed of the Yala bombings and has instructed national police chief Gen. Prewpan Dhamapong to investigate the crime scene immediately, according to MCOT. Police investigators believe suspected insurgents are behind the attacks, MCOT said.

Last month, a series of bombs detonated in Bangkok. No one was killed in those blasts, and an Iranian suspect was arrested in connection with the incident.
Los Angeles (CNN) -- Comedienne Joan Rivers says she will "stand behind" what she told a paparazzo about not feeling sadness for civilians killed in Gaza.

Rivers made her controversial comments at the Los Angeles airport Wednesday when a photographer for Splash News Online asked her about the nearly 2,000 Palestinian killed over the last month since Israel launched military operations in Gaza in response to Hamas rocket attacks.

"When you declare war, you declare war," Rivers said. "They started it. We now don't count who's dead. You're dead. You deserve to be dead. You started it. You started it. Don't you dare make me feel sad about that."

Rivers compared Israel's operations against Gaza to the United States' dropping atomic bombs on Japan 69 years ago.

"You were told to get out, you don't get out, then you know you're an idiot, and at least the ones that were killed were the ones with very low IQs," Rivers said.

Celebs step into Israel-Gaza PR minefield

Rivers posted what she called an "accurate clarification" of her comments on her Facebook page Thursday afternoon, but it was not an apology. Instead, she said she was "saddened and disappointed" that her words were "totally taken out of context" by the media.

"The media, as usual, has decided to only quote the most out of context and inflammatory non sequitur rather than giving an accurate account of what my intentions were behind the statement," Rivers said.

She's "tired of bearing the brunt of attacks by people who want to sell newspapers or gain ratings by creating a scandal about me that is non-existent," Rivers said.

"What I said and stand behind is, war is hell and unfortunately civilians are victims of political conflicts," Rivers said.

Rivers said she was "praying for peace" in the Middle East.

Jon Voight: Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz 'ignorant' about Israel and Gaza

The Palestinian Ministry of Health said as of Thursday that 1,888 people, including 446 children, have died and 9,804 injured in Gaza in the past month. The United Nations has estimated that at least 70% of the dead were civilians. The Israel Defense Forces believes it killed about 900 militants -- roughly half of the dead.

Israeli officials have said 64 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel died.

Clock ticking on Gaza truce talks in Cairo
Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday led Justice Department tributes to former presidential adviser and Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, who died at 90.

Holder had a personal connection to Katzenbach, remembered for facing down Alabama Gov. George Wallace at a schoolhouse door in June 1963 to desegregate the University of Alabama.

Cameras recorded the confrontation between Katzenbach, then serving as deputy attorney general, and Wallace. The governor declared the desegregation "illegal and unwarranted" and stood in the doorway.

Katzenbach replied, "Governor, I am not interested in a show."

The Alabama National Guard enforced the registration of two African-American students and Wallace grudgingly stepped aside.

One of the students was Vivian Malone, a sister of Sharon Malone, who later married Holder.

Katzenbach died of natural causes Tuesday at his home in Skillman, New Jersey, according to Princeton University, where Katzenbach earned a degree and served as trustee emeritus.

He was a top adviser to President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy on several key issues, including the Cuban missile crisis.

Katzenbach was attorney general for two years during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

Katzenbach drafted and â€” serving as Johnson's liaison to Congress â€” secured passage of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act, according to Princeton.

Holder called Katzenbach "one of our nation's great champions of civil rights and equal justice."

Katzenbach, a New Jersey native, attended top prep schools and Ivy League colleges. He went to Germany to fight in World War II. His plane was shot down and he was captured by the Nazis and taken prisoner.

According to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Katzenbach in October 1962 drafted a legal brief in support of Kennedy's decision to blockade Cuba.

Holder said Katzenbach will continue to be "an inspiration for me, for my colleagues across the Department of Justice, and for the nation he was so proud to serve."

Katzenbach was deputy attorney general from 1962 to 1964, and attorney general in 1965 and 1966. He also served as undersecretary of state from 1966 to 1969.

He is survived by his wife, Lydia; sons, John and Christopher; his daughters, Maria and Anne; and six grandchildren. A memorial service was being planned.
(CNN) -- Sin Hwa Dee began operations in the 1970s as a cottage industry in the former soya sauce-producing enclave of Kim Chuan Road, in the Paya Lebar area of Singapore.

Mr. and Mrs. Chng Kee started out producing soya and oyster sauces, bean paste and plum paste in the 1970s.

It was founded by the late Mr. Chng Kee, a former soya salesman, who ran the business with his wife, a soya production operator.

Together they sold mainly soya and oyster sauces, bean paste and plum paste in bulk under the Sin Hwa Dee label to the restaurant, hotel and catering industries.

In 1990, the company began producing the preserved fruits and vegetables used to make the traditional Lunar New Year dish of Yu Sheng.

One of Sin Hwa Dee's factories is dedicated exclusively to the production of Yu Sheng products, while another factory produces noodles for the restaurant and catering industries.

Mr. Chng's daughter Jocelyn first decided to introduce the company's products to the foreign market when she attended the SIAL exhibition in Paris in 1992, noting that there was a clear interest in Asian food.

Sin Hwa Dee's first premix, the Laksa Paste, was launched into the food services market under the CHNG Kee's label in 1994, followed by the Kung Bo Sauce, the Black Pepper Sauce and their famous chicken rice mix.

In 1996, the company invested heavily in equipment and technology to produce sauces and premixes in bottles for the retail market under the CHNG Kee's label.

In 2005, Sin Hwa Dee moved into their own building, CHNG Kee's Foodlink, located in Senoko South Road, north of Singapore, with a production team of over 75 employees producing more than 20 tons of sauces per day.

Today, their clientele includes Singapore Airlines, Pizza Hut, KFC, Burger King, hotels such as the Ritz Carlton, Conrad International Centenniel, Raffles Hotel, Hilton Hotel, Marriott Hotel, and restaurants such as Lei Garden and Crystal Jade.
(CNN)Japan's Shimanami Kaido might be an expressway, but it was designed with the cyclist in mind.

A spectacular 60-kilometer road-and-bridge network connecting Japan's main island of Honshu with Shikoku (the nation's fourth largest island), it spans six smaller islands in the process and features bike and pedestrian lanes for its entire length.

The sublime scenery of the Shimanami Kaido (Island-Wave-Sea Route) runs from Onomichi in Hiroshima Prefecture down to Imabari in Ehime Prefecture.

Whichever way you travel, the views of the Seto Inland Sea National Park are sublime.

Cycling gives you the freedom to stop for a photo halfway across a bridge or detour to investigate lighthouses, shrines and natural wonders most automobile travelers zip past.

With 14 cycle rental terminals along the way, you can go at your own pace, spend a night at a campsite or inn or just hand your bike in at the nearest rental terminal and hop on a bus.

Some terminals even have electric bicycles for hire.

Experienced cyclists will be able to complete the entire route  -- there are a few challenging spots -- in a few hours.

Here's a look at some of the highlights.

Starting point: Onomichi

As of March, Onomichi is home to Japan's first hotel designed exclusively for cyclists: Hotel Cycle in the Onomichi U2 building, just five minutes' walk from the JR station.

Manager Katsunori Takahashi is huge cycling enthusiast, and it shows.

You can park your bike in your room, and there's even a cycle-through restaurant.

Taiwanese bike manufacturer Giant has a store in U2 catering to cyclists: bikes, accessories, repairs.

U2's Shima Shop sells local produce such as lemon comfiture and dried debera (five-spot flounder), an Onomichi delicacy.

As for Onomichi itself, the town was built on a hillside overlooking the sea, so the best way to see it before you head onto the Shimanami Kaido is to catch the ropeway to the top of Senkoji Hill and enjoy the panorama.

The walk down the Path of Literature is pleasant -- it winds past past boulders engraved with works by famous writers who've stayed in Onomichi over the centuries.

You'll see the splendid Senkoji Temple, which dates from 806 AD, one of the oldest temples in Japan.

A stamina boost comes in the form of Onomichi's legendary ramen.

Tsutafuji is one of the most popular ramen shops in town.

It's a mom and pop waterfront bar near the JR station that's been open more than 50 years.

There are just 10 stools inside, so you may have wait a while.

Once inside, you'll get a bowlful of noodles topped with pork in a pork-bone-and-fish broth.

'Orchard of Japan'

After a day in Onomichi, it's time to roll.

As soon as you've crossed Onomichi Strait and reached Mukaishima Island, you'll find yourself in a serene realm of citrus groves, set in the folds of forest-clad mountains.

Citrus is big business here.

The town of Setoda is Japan's number one producer of lemons, while Ehime Prefecture is known as the Orchard of Japan.

There are tangerines, oranges and hybrid fruits unique to these islands, such as anseikan (a cannonball-sized grapefruit).

Citrus-related products abound: cakes, jams, honey, sauces, juices.

World's longest suspension bridge

As you breeze across the routes magnificent bridges (seven of them), a labyrinth of misty islands unfolds below.

There are inhabited islands, desert islands and islands that are no more than a rock with a lone pine tree clinging to it.

A procession of trawlers, tugs and speedboats glides in and out the channels.

As for those bridges, their exquisite state of the art forms make them an attraction in their own right.

Tatara is one of the world's longest cable-stayed bridges -- its elegant 220-meter-high steel towers represent the folded wings of a crane.

At 4,045 meters long, Kurushima Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the world.

Temples, fusion food, stunning sea

Deep in the heart of rural Japan, there's a rich amount of art and culture to enjoy.

Kosanji Temple on Ikuchijima Island is a must-visit.

Built in 1936 by Buddhist priest Koso Kosanji in memory of his mother, this wonderland of temples, pagodas and natural beauty took more than 30 years to complete.

Each building is modeled on famous temple buildings in Kyoto, Nikko and elsewhere, so visiting is like taking a stroll through Japanese history.

For the perfect ending to a trip (should you choose to loop back the way you came) you can't go wrong with the Bella Vista Hotel in the hills outside Onomichi.

The rooms are huge and offer views over the supreme serenity of the island-dotted sea.

There's exquisite fusion in the hotel's Italian restaurant (blowfish and tagliarini).

The hotel spa is open to the elements on one side, allowing fresh ocean breezes to cool your skin as you boil to a jelly while watching Jupiter rise over the Seto Sea.

Former president of Poland, Lech Walesa, was a founder of the Solidarity trade union group that helped bring about about the downfall of communism in Poland in 1989.

He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 and was the country's president from 1990 to 1995. His eponymous Lech Walesa Institute was set up in 1995 to support concepts of independence, ethics and state decentralization.

CNN asked him about his recollections from 25 years ago and his thoughts on the future of Poland.

CNN: What are you strongest memories from this time 25 years ago?

Lech Walesa: I prefer to look at today and tomorrow. Sometimes, however, it's good to take a look back to learn a lesson from the past.

There have been so many events with influence on the present time that they form a chain of events reaching back much further than 1989. It all dates back to 1970, when the social discontent reached its peak and forced many of us to take to the streets.

Next, we witnessed the election of Karol Wojtyła to the Papacy, the August Agreements, the creation of Solidarity, the imposition of martial law, the Round Table Talks, the partially-free election in 1989, then my presidency as a seal of freedom and lastly the admission of Poland to NATO and to the European Union.

I consider all these elements to be consecutive links in the chain of freedom, without which neither Poland nor Europe would be free.

CNN: What was the biggest challenge you faced personally during your days with Solidarity before 1989?

Lech Walesa: The most important one was to persevere in unity. To stick to our goal. Not to be broken down. And yet we were so badly impacted by martial law.

In prison we went through an ordeal. We were not broken down. Our faith was never shaken. It was strengthened by what happened in August 1980. This is our great victory. At that time, nobody expected us to succeed. We had a vivid memory of the tragic events of December 1970. We knew we had to work together.

Already on the first day we set up an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee and started to work on the demands. We eventually managed to hammer out 21 demands, which were signed on December 31st together with the government, which was represented by Mieczysław Jagielski. This was our greatest challenge and greatest victory.

Soon after, our tiny union had 10 million members all over Poland. The 1980s were a time of struggle to build an organization and its structures. It was also a fight for unity and perseverance in the path we had chosen. Although weakened, we were not defeated and so we lasted until 1988 and 1989.

We lost a couple of battles, but we won the war for democracy and freedom. It's because we were working in solidarity. And the world was in solidarity with us.

CNN: What gave you the strength to continue the struggle against the communist government in Poland? What qualities do you think you had that made you do what you did?

Lech Walesa: This is made up of several things. One of them was our faith that this sick, unfair system must finally collapse.

We didn't know how to make it happen, how to get organized so as not to repeat the mistakes made in 1970 (during the protests).

In my opinion, divine providence helped us at this stage. It's then that a Pole who became pope helped us to organize ourselves in prayer and also made us understand our inner strength. His regular visits to Poland, although hindered by the communist authorities, played this role.

The masses celebrated by the Holy Father gathered millions of Poles. We could see that we were many, that we were millions. Before that, we had been scattered and divided. It was the first time in post-war Poland that the Polish nation had joined forces on such a massive scale.

I'm sure that had there been no pontificate of John Paul II, the Fall of Communism wouldn't have happened as quickly or as peacefully as it did. The Holy Father did not call us to fight, but gathered us in prayer. And we were able to match actions with words.

CNN: Do you have any regrets from your life during the anti-communist days?

Lech Walsa: Concerning our peaceful struggle, I have no regrets whatsoever. Of course, when I look at it today, from the perspective of years, I wish I had done a few things differently, but as for the path we took, I wouldn't have changed it.

Despite such a great victory, I have a feeling that I missed something. When I was fighting, when I was repeatedly arrested and in prison or when I traveled all over the country to coordinate the activity of unions, my wife and the children were left behind at home. Regrettably, I was not with them.

It's probably my greatest failure: I was not with my family when they needed me most. For this I want to thank my wife Danuta. For the fact that she put up with me and brought up our children to be good people.

CNN: How do you see Poland today?

Lech Walesa: We are now in a very different place, in a new era.

Today we can say with confidence that we live in a democratic Poland, in a firmly established free market economic system, in a country built on solid foundations of international cooperation and in a country of high aspirations and hopes for further development.

Our success has been noticed. There are many who point to Poland as an example of wise economic policy. We are amongst the few countries that emerged from the financial crisis relatively unscathed.

The 2012 European Championship was another type of promotion of Poland and an opportunity to show off our achievements.

I'm also very happy to see that even those projects, which seemed doomed to failure due to the very last decisions of the communists, have in fact been able to be saved, such as my beloved Gdańsk Shipyard, the cradle of "Solidarity".

Today it is slowly rising to its feet again and building ships after many years of struggle and hope for its rescue; there is a chance that jobs can be safeguarded and that the symbol of the Polish transformation can be saved. This fills me with happiness, even if the costs of transformation were high.

Today Poland is a truly beautiful, modern and open country.

CNN: Is it the country today as you hoped it would be when you cast your vote in June 1989?

Lech Walesa: Back in 1989, nothing was a foregone conclusion. We had to build a state system almost from scratch. The difficult (political and economic) reforms of minister of finance Leszek Balcerowicz and the prime minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki allowed us to make further changes.

In conjunction with Boris Yeltsin, I negotiated the withdrawal of Red Army troops from Poland. We then became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and today we are also a member of the European Union.

At that time, I didn't even dream that we would manage to achieve all that, and in such a short time. It's true, Poland as we see it today is beyond anything we could have dreamt of at that time.

However, I regret that not everything worked out as it should have. My presidency ended after five years and I had a plan that would have required two terms to fully realize. Later on, the politics of Aleksander Kwaśniewski were not in line with my concept.

CNN: Do you think democracy in Poland and other former communist states is in good shape?

Lech Walesa: It might seem so, but we still have a problem with the sense of responsibility for the country amongst our citizens. We recently held the election to the European Parliament, a very important election, in which decided who would be representing us at the European Union. The average turnout throughout the EU was low -- only 43%. In Poland, however, it stood at 23%. And even lower than that in Slovakia and in the Czech Republic. It's alarming.

First we expect "old Europe" to accept us and treat us on an equal footing and then we renounce our right to vote. Moreover, parties with extremist views are on the rise. These parties promote ideas that contradict democracy and the European Union's reason for existence.

We must therefore wake up, because if we continue to be indifferent, we may ourselves destroy our great dream of international solidarity.

On the other hand, I'm a 100% democrat and if parties with such an outlook on life enter the parliament, I have no choice but to accept it. I only call for votes during the next election to be cast in a well-conceived manner.

CNN: What is the biggest challenge facing Poland and Polish society today?

Lech Walesa: The biggest challenge for Poland, Europe and the world is the reshuffling and widening of structures.

I have already been saying it for quite some time: we must evolve past thinking in terms of the nation state and the European state.

We live in an era of intellect, information and globalization. We live under new conditions that require us to create a totally different set of programs and structures.

It's a task not only for Poland, but also for the entire population of contemporary Europe and the world at large. Our present systems do not meet our current needs.

The new era offers us new challenges. We who destroyed communism, whose downfall has triggered a domino effect of transformation throughout Europe, should provide an example and inspiration for the entire world.

We must show how to change even the most difficult reality through purely democratic means, without the use of violence. Today we must ask ourselves which world we are going to built in this new era and how democracy and globalization are going to look.

For a long time already, I have been calling for the development of a Decalogue of universal values that would serve as a lasting reference point for this new Europe and the world. We must define and accept laws establishing common principles, which would allow nations and religions to co-exist in a spirit of respect for differences and friendly cooperation.

Once such a universal basis is established, we will succeed in building lasting and safe communities. Otherwise it may be hard to maintain the world as it is at present.
(CNN) -- The protests that have spread through parts of the Arab world led to dramatic change in another country Tuesday, as Jordan's king dismissed his government.

King Abdullah II made the decision following protests in recent weeks in which several thousand people demanded economic and political reforms.

Experts on the region said Tuesday Abdullah's decision was aimed at warding off larger-scale demonstrations in the wake of the huge protests in Tunisia and Egypt.  The Tunisia protests, which began the movement, toppled that country's government.  In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak has fired his Cabinet, but protesters in massive demonstrations continue to call for his ouster.

The protests -- which have also caught on to various extents in Algeria, Yemen, and Sudan -- have proved to be "a real watershed event for the Arab world," said Blake Hounshell, managing editor of Foreign Policy magazine.  "It's really unprecedented."

There was a series of protests in Arab nations in the 1950s, but those were prompted by an ideology of Pan-Arabism in a post-colonial world, said Emile Hokayem, with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.  A 2005 uprising in Lebanon was about independence and ousting Syria.  While it was successful, the revolution's message was not one that other nations associated with, he said.

"It's different this time.  People are standing up for their economic rights, their dignity. It's very different," said Hokayem.

Ibrahim Sharqieh of the Brookings Institution said there's a whole new mind-set.

"The Tunisian uprising has caused change in the attitude and behavior of ordinary Arab citizens -- and today we are witnessing the emergence of a can-do nation attitude," he explained.

Economic concerns have fueled the protests across the region.  At a speech Tuesday in Singapore, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said the need for action against unemployment was "a strong undercurrent of the political turmoil in Tunisia, and of rising social strains in other countries," according to his prepared remarks.

Arab leaders have been getting the message, Hokayem said, noting an article in the Wall Street Journal in which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said leaders must "see the need of reform" before protests like those in Egypt and Tunisia break out, because by then "it's too late to do any reform."

Abdullah's decision and Assad's remarks "are preventive moves," said Hokayem.

Hounshell noted that the Jordanian king has sacked his government before in recent years.  "But in the context of what's happening now, it's going to be seen as a way to get ahead of these protests."

When the Tunisia protests proved successful at first, many analysts still doubted a "domino theory" would play out through the Middle East, said Hokayem, because each nation has a different structure, population, and set of challenges.  But "right now, it seems like it's a possibility.  So I think governments are trying to prevent what could be copycat movements in the region."

The level of solidarity in the Arab world has come as a surprise to some experts, said Hokayem.  But "it's a matter of psychology at this point. People feel that there is an overture, and they want to push, want to do it."

Still, there are key differences.  "I still think that monarchies have an edge in terms of legitimacy," Hokayem said.  Tunisia, Egypt, and Yemen are officially republics, and leaders were gearing up for successions by bringing their children to power, sparking fury and frustration in an underserved population.

In Gulf state monarchies, such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia, uprisings that threaten the government are "less likely," said Hounshell.  "But I wouldn't rule it out."

The United States views Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia as key allies in the region.  The Saudi kingdom has been stable for decades.  "If Saudi Arabia starts to see popular protests," said Hounshell, "then you're really going to see people in Washington freak out."

It remains unclear how far the change in any of these countries might go. In Jordan, whether the king will regain support from protesters by dismissing his government is "a million dollar question," said Hounshell.
(CNN) -- While forecasters predicted cooler days ahead for some of the United States, millions endured sizzling temperatures Saturday, with St. Louis marking its 10th consecutive day of 100 degrees and higher.

A cold front was expected to bring much-needed relief in communities baking in a lingering heat wave.

The front was to move across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes on Saturday, and into Ohio and the northeast the following day, bringing significantly cooler air, according to the National Weather Service. An excessive heat warning ended in the Chicago area.

Despite the cold front, temperatures could remain high until Sunday. The heat wave has left scores dead and hundreds of thousands without power.

Saturday's high of 107 in St. Louis broke a 103-degree mark set in 1936, said Butch Dye, hydrometeorologist technician for the National Weather Service.

But conditions were expected to improve somewhat Sunday, with a high in the lower to mid-90s. Monday's expected 89 will match the normal high, said Dye.

Temperatures topped 100 degrees Saturday in a swath stretching from south-central Iowa to the Chicago area to Louisville, Kentucky, to Virginia, the weather service said.

Saturday's highs included 106 in Louisville; 105 in Lexington, Kentucky; 104 in Richmond, Virginia; 104 in Nashville, Tennessee; and 101 in Reading, Pennsylvania.

A 4-month-old girl in Greenfield, Indiana, died after being left in a car for an "extended period of time," police Chief John Jester said. While it wasn't clear how hot it had been inside the car, temperatures in that community of 20,000 people reached 103 degrees.

The baby's grandfather found the young girl and rushed her to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her father, Joshua Stryzinski, was later arrested and charged with neglect of a dependent, resulting in death. Jester said that charge may change after detectives meet with prosecutors.

About 25 miles northwest in the town of Fishers, Meg E. Trueblood was arrested for felony neglect of a dependent after her 16-month-old unattended daughter was pulled from a car at a shopping center, police said.

The toddler was rushed to the hospital in critical condition, said police spokesman Tom Weger. The temperature inside the vehicle was 124 degrees, said Weger, adding the baby was inside it for about one hour. An officer broke a window to reach the little girl.

Fishers is just northeast of Indianapolis, where the thermometer hit 105 degrees.

The heat wave is leaving a significant mark: Nationwide, there have been more than 4,500 daily record highs in the last 30 days, according to the National Climatic Data Center. Also, the heat has brought nearly 240 all-time record highs between June 23 and July 5, CNN meteorologist Alexandra Steele said Saturday.

Triple-digit strategies for staying healthy

Forecasters said the cold front will help bring those numbers down some Sunday -- but at a cost. The front is expected to carry damaging storms, with large hail and strong winds, Steele said.

"It's relief at a price," Steele said.

She predicted a long, hot summer for the country.

"Heat begets heat," Steele said.

In Maryland, 10 heat-related deaths have been counted since Monday, said the state's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

All 10 victims were men, and all but two were more than 65 years old -- with the exceptions being between ages 45 and 64 -- the Maryland agency said. Five deaths were in Baltimore, two in Baltimore County, two in Montgomery County and one in Wicomico County, according to the department.

Meanwhile, about 322,000 customers across 12 states and the District of Columbia suffered Saturday in the heat without the benefits of electricity, including power for their air conditioning and for refrigeration to keep their food edible, according to a CNN count Saturday evening.

Because utilities typically define each residential and business account as a customer, the actual number of people affected was not clear.

Many of these people have gone without power for a full week, thanks to strong storms fueled by the heat that barreled east from Indiana to New Jersey. Others have watched more recent but similar storms leave them in the dark.

The hardest-hit state continues to be West Virginia, where about 116,000 customers had no power Saturday.

Residents have been stocking up on ice to try to save food from spoiling in their useless refrigerators to the point that stores have sold out of it, CNN affiliate WSAZ reported.

Roger Harrah said he traveled from county to county, some 60 miles, searching for ice Friday and finally found a store with some.

"I thought I better get some while I can," Harrah said. "I tell you what, it is rough living without ice."

The extreme heat has also damaged roads.

Wisconsin received about 30 reports of roads buckling Thursday, according to transportation officials. Earlier this week, a viral video showed an SUV airborne after hitting a patch of buckled Wisconsin highway. Missouri has also warned drivers to be on the look-out for pavement buckling from heat.

And since June 23, scores of cities have been the hottest they've ever been, on any day ever recorded. That includes 107 in Colorado Springs, 109 in Nashville and 106 in Atlanta. In Washington, the thermometer has gone past 95 degrees for nine straight days -- the longest such streak since modern record-keeping began.

CNN's Michael Martinez, Phil Gast, Maggie Schneider and Monica O'Connor contributed to this report.
(CNN) -- In a down economy, pursuing the American dream can be challenging, but restaurant owner Todd Steele was willing to take a chance.

For nearly 20 years, Steele worked all levels of the restaurant game, from dishwasher to general manager, before partnering with his mom and opening his own eatery called Metrovino on Portland, Oregon's, 11th Avenue streetcar line.

"I would not have picked this spot if it weren't for the streetcar, and my business has certainly benefited from our location," Steele said. "Streetcars are also a romantic way to travel, and they are fun to watch from inside Metrovino."

While America lost much of its love for streetcars as public transportation during the 1960s, a few cities have kept the romance burning. The heart of San Francisco includes its nearly 140-year-old electric cable car system. In New Orleans, the location for Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire," many tourists are drawn by the picturesque St. Charles Avenue Line.

The Obama administration recently offered some U.S. cities a piece of a  $130 million federal fund for streetcar projects aimed at reducing traffic congestion, cutting pollution and reliance on foreign oil, and creating jobs. Transit systems in Dallas, St. Louis, Cincinnati and Charlotte, North Carolina, are slated to share grants from the Federal Transit Administration's Urban Circulator program.

Other cities have plans and other funding for streetcar projects, too.

But not everyone is a fan of streetcars. "This is a waste of money," said Ron Utt of The Heritage Foundation.

"Streetcars certainly create jobs, but they are a poor investment and create little lasting value," he said. "Because it requires extensive ongoing subsidies, it is also unsustainable. Improving roads would be the better bet in most communities."

CNN iReporter Raymond Becich is a supporter. "Sure, Portland paid incentives to businesses to build along the streetcar (line)," he said. "But how is this any different than any governmental jurisdiction giving tax breaks and other incentives for businesses to relocate to a city or state?"

Streetcars have transformed a "blighted warehouse district ... into a vibrant area of shops, grocery stores, restaurants and apartments that provide entertainment and employment," he said.

But there's nothing streetcars can do that buses can't do better, faster, safer and for far less money, said CATO Institute senior fellow Randal O'Toole. "Even though a single light-rail train can hold more passengers than a bus, a bus route can move more passengers per hour than any light-rail line."

Portland's streetcar system attracts about 12,000 daily riders at an average ticket cost of $1.47. Its creators credit it with $3.5 billion in surrounding development, including shops, restaurants and 10,000 new housing units.

Also, streetcars that run on either hydro or coal-generated electricity spit out less greenhouse gases per passenger mile than diesel buses, according to University of California researchers.

So, what is a streetcar, exactly? The transportation community generally defines it as a rail-based passenger tram that shares streets with cars and trucks.

Becich said he rides his city's system so often he's considering selling his car.

"Riding public transportation in Portland is quick, easy and enjoyable," he said. "It's absolutely easier than driving, and streetcar operators go out of their way to be helpful."

But is it faster than driving? "If you count the time from point A to B, it is slower to ride the streetcar," Becich said. "But if you factor in time to find a place to park and the cost of parking, it is more convenient and cheaper to ride the streetcar."

It's no secret that public transit offers commuters an escape from hectic traffic and a chance to read, make phone calls or snooze.

These transportation issues were recently at the heart of an $85 million question faced by leaders and residents of Fort Worth, Texas: Should they green-light a proposed three-mile streetcar line from LaGrave Field through downtown and into the near-south side?

After much debate, city leaders decided "no" earlier this month "because of the timing and questions regarding how it would be fully funded."

As many as 2,250 people were projected to use the system daily, according to a city study. Utt says that's not very many riders, considering the cost of building and maintaining the line. "Most ridership projections are overly optimistic," he said. "There are good reasons why most cities got rid of their trolley systems in the '50s and '60s."

A federal transportation official acknowledged that ridership is often low, according to industry studies.

In Michigan, supporters are working to bring a light-rail line to revitalize downtown Detroit, a city among the hardest hit by the recession.

But on Capitol Hill, a House transportation committee spokesman acknowledged that there may be less federal money available for streetcar projects as Republicans prepare to take control of the House in January.

Transportation blogger Yonah Freemark agreed. "Based on recent decisions by party members at the state and national level, that will mean a renewed emphasis on roadway projects and less proposed funding for transit."
WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Angelina Jolie was on a stage Thursday but wasn't performing. Instead, she paid tribute to the millions of uprooted people across the globe made homeless by war.

Angelina Jolie said that sheltering countries can learn from the way refugees survive their difficulties.

A U.N. goodwill ambassador, Jolie was in Washington to observe World Refugee Day, an annual event that falls on Saturday this year. The poignant ceremony was sponsored by the United Nations refugee agency.

Tears flowed as refugees and displaced people shared their harrowing experiences and advocates related what they'd seen in refugee camps.

"I believe we must persuade the world that refugees must not be simply viewed as a burden," she said. "They are the survivors. And they can bring those qualities to the service of their communities and the countries that shelter them."

Jolie spoke of her visits to refugee camps in Tanzania and Pakistan.

She met a boy about 15 years old in a Tanzanian refugee camp who, without a wheelchair, had to crawl since a shot in the back paralyzed him. His family was killed, leaving him as an orphan. Yet when he spoke with her, he did it with a smile.

"He had this really remarkable, unbreakable spirit," she told CNN's Anderson Cooper after the event at the National Geographic Museum.

"I think of him and I can't complain about anything ... he was grateful and he had nothing and suffered everything."

The boy died a few months after she met him, Jolie said.

According to a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees survey of displacement trends in 2008, there are 42 million uprooted people -- 15.2 million were refugees, 26 million were internally displaced people and 827,000 were asylum seekers.

Afghans and Iraqis constituted almost half of all refugees worldwide. One out of four refugees was from Afghanistan, and 69 countries accepted Afghan refugees for asylum, agency officials found.

Jolie recounted her meeting with a pregnant Afghan refugee.

She lived in a small, roofless dirt house in an abandoned refugee camp in Pakistan and could not leave with the others because she was too far along in her pregnancy.

Pakistan struggles with the largest refugee population in the world, about 1.8 million, according to the United Nations. The country also has more than 2 million internally displaced citizens, largely because of the fighting between the Pakistani military and the Taliban since April.

Antonio Guterres, head of the U.N.'s refugee agency, elaborated on the plight of displaced people at the event.

He said internally displaced people "face the same plight [as refugees]. They have lost the same as refugees. They don't have the same international protections granted to refugees."

Conflicts like those in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Somalia have caused more people to flee their homes, though the number of displaced people declined by about 700,000 in 2008, the report said.

Recent fighting in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Somalia last year brought total displacement in each to 1.5 million and 1.3 million, respectively. More than 2 million internally displaced people were in Sudan's Darfur region, according to the report.

When a genocide targeting Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994 later spilled over into the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rose Mapendo, a Tutsi, was caught in the middle. She spoke at the event and described her ordeal.

Mapendo, her husband and seven children were thrown into a death camp, where her husband was executed and her children starved, she said through tears.

While at the prison, she learned that she was pregnant. She gave birth in silence, on a concrete floor, Mapendo said. To her surprise, she had twins, and to her captors' surprise, she named her newborns after them. Soon after her gesture toward the prison commanders, her family was freed after their 16-month ordeal.

Mapendo, named a CNN Hero in October, created Mapendo International, a nonprofit dedicated to identifying, saving and resettling endangered refugees. She was named humanitarian of the year at the event by the U.N. agency.

"I want to encourage the refugees don't give up," she said. Giving up "is not an option."

Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- More than 30 people were killed Monday in southeastern Kenya in the latest outbreak of tribal violence.

A mob of more than 300 people descended on the village of Kilelengwani in the remote Tana Delta on Monday, many of them armed with spears and machetes, the Kenya Red Cross said.

Thirty-three men, women and children were killed, including seven police officers who had been deployed to the area as a buffer between warring tribes.

The massacre comes just days after nearly a dozen people were killed in the same region in what appears to be continued tit-for-tat violence that erupted last month.

The violence is blamed on the Pokomo and Orma tribes prevalent in the region. The Pokomo are largely settled farmers, and the Orma are traditionally pastoralists, tending cattle and goat herds.

There has been long-running tension between the two groups over grazing rights and water sources, but it boiled over last month when the Pokomo attacked an Orma village after an apparent land dispute.

More than 50 people were killed in that attack, mostly women and children.

The revenge attacks are the worst violence in Kenya since more than a thousand people were killed and hundreds of thousands were left homeless after a disputed election in late 2007.

Kenya's security forces have been heavily criticized for being unable to quell the escalating violence along the Tana River.

Samuel Kilele, the police commissioner of the coast, said hundreds of police were in the area, but rugged terrain and poor infrastructure made it hard to get there. He said four local administrators were being fired for their lack of a response.

But in a move indicating the seriousness of the situation, he said the Kenyan military could be brought in to bring security to the region.

"If the situation proves more volatile, then the deployment of the army will be inevitable," Kilele said.
(CNN) -- As oil began approaching the coast of the United States, environmental scientists said the effects of the spill in the Gulf of Mexico could have ecological and biological consequences for years, if not decades.

The intricate ecosystem is a major source of seafood for the United States and hundreds of species of animals and plants are at risk, experts said.

Some areas in the path of the slick are particularly sensitive to problems because unlike the rocky coast of Alaska hit by oil from the Exxon Valdez disaster, much of the coastline that will be hit by the BP spill consists of marshy areas where the water is calmer and more difficult to clean.

The marshes are in extreme danger, said a biologist with the University of Houston who studies coastal wetlands.

"It's likely going to persist for decades because it will get into the marsh where there is very little wave action and the soil is oxygen poor," said Steve Pennings. "The immediate acute impact might not be that severe because there is not much oil getting to a certain spot, but because the oil might stick around [in the sediment] for 20 years you might have a real chronic effect."

The oil spill started April 20 after an explosion on the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven oil-rig workers remain missing and are presumed dead. The rig sank April 22 about 50 miles off the southeast coast of Louisiana and the untapped wellhead is gushing oil into the Gulf. About 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion, the Coast Guard said.

Wetlands in Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states were already struggling because of sea-level rise and the lack of sediment due to some rivers being channelized, Pennings said.

Mike Beck, senior scientist on the global marine team for the Nature Conservancy, said there is a lot of concern for oyster reefs, which were also already suffering. Only 15 percent of the world's oyster reefs remain because of over-harvesting and dredging, he said, and hurricanes have also destroyed some reefs. He said there have been some oil spills in Europe that provide clues as to what might happen.

"What we have learned from other accidents is we've seen mortality and then we have seen lower growth rate," he said, "so that even if they're not killed, you are likely to have much lower [population] growth. We're not likely to be able to eat those oysters for quite some time because ... they hold heavy metals in their tissue."

He estimated that the damage to the reefs could last two to five years, but that other oil spills have shown that in some instances it can be longer than that.

Beck pointed out that 40 percent of the U.S. seafood supply comes from the northern Gulf of Mexico and 95 percent of the species in the seafood harvest are dependent on the health of the nation's estuaries and marshes.

Environmentalist Richard Charter of the Defenders of Wildlife organization said the size of the oil spill will be overwhelming to cleanup crews.

"This event is a self-feeding fire," Charter said. "It is so big and expanding so fast that it's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective. ... You're looking at a long-term poisoning of the area. Ultimately, this will have a multidecade impact."

Some officials worried the destruction could surpass the Exxon Valdez disaster of 20 years ago. That oil tanker ran aground on the Bligh Reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989 and spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil.

The surface oil from the Exxon Valdez spill had largely disappeared within three years of the spill, according to studies conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Response and Restoration. The 1997 report said that what oil did remain could be found on beaches that were near still water. The residual oil was not nearly as toxic as the oil studied in the days after the spill. The report said "intertidal species can tolerate its presence even though it can accumulate in their tissues."

However, a 2003 study published in the journal Science disputed the NOAA finding of toxicity and said that oil in the sediment was still harming the species more than a decade after the accident.

The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustees Council also disagreed. A spokeswoman told the Anchorage Daily News last year that oil in some parts of the sound is still toxic.

All the scientists CNN spoke to said that the long-term impacts of the spill depend on how much oil reaches the coast. The choppy seas are hindering containment efforts, experts said.

"The question is -- we rarely clean up more than 15 or 20 percent of a spill on a calm day, and we aren't seeing a calm day," Charter said.

The impact will also depend on what states are hit. Beck said there are two major loop currents and one runs along the Louisiana wetlands past Mississippi and Alabama then down the coast of Florida and around the Keys.

"Eventually that water moves out into the Caribbean and the Atlantic," he said, indicating the East Coast needs to pay attention to where the oil is traveling.
(CNN) -- Chelsea moved quickly to replace the sacked Roberto Di Matteo Wednesday as Rafael Benitez was appointed as interim manager until the end of the season.

The English Premier League side made the announcement on their official website, just hours after the departure of Di Matteo, who had led them to European Champions League glory for the first time earlier this year.

Former Valencia and Liverpool manager Benitez will be thrown in at the deep end, with Chelsea taking on EPL reigning champions and leaders Manchester City Sunday.

"The owner and the Board believe that in Benitez we have a manager with significant experience at the highest level of football, who can come in and immediately help deliver our objectives," read the club statement.

"The 52-year-old Spaniard is due to meet the players at the training ground in Cobham tomorrow (Thursday)," it added.

Benitez, who will be the ninth manager under owner Roman Abramovich, has been out of work since being sacked by Inter Milan in December 2010.

He guided Valencia to two Spanish titles and the UEFA Cup and spent six years at Liverpool, highlighted by their Champions League triumph in 2005 and reaching the final in 2007.

Former Barcelona manager Pepe Guardiola has been linked with the Chelsea job, but is currently on a year-long sabbatical after leaving the Catalan giants at the end of last season.

Di Matteo, who also won the FA Cup with Chelsea during his brief spell in charge, paid the price for a poor recent run of results, culminating in a 3-0 defeat to Juventus Tuesday which leaves their participation in the knockout stages of this season's Champions League in considerable doubt.
New York (CNN) -- Planned Parenthood of New York City blasted the city's new Teen Pregnancy Prevention Campaign on Thursday, saying it won't deter teen pregnancy and inappropriately shames and stigmatizes its target audience.

The campaign "creates stigma, hostility and negative public opinions about teen pregnancy and parenthood rather than offering alternative aspirations for young people," said Haydee Morales, the organization's vice president of education and training. "The city's money would be better spent helping teens access health care, birth control and high-quality sexual and reproductive health education, not on an ad campaign intended to create shock value."

The New York City Human Resources Administration/Department of Social Services announced the $400,000 initiative, which features pictures of babies delivering messages to their hypothetical parents such as "Honestly, mom... chances are he won't stay with you. What happens to me?" The small print adds that 90% of teen parents don't marry each other.

"Dad, you'll be paying to support me for the next 20 years," says another of the ads, which adds in smaller print that "NY State law requires a parent to pay child support until a child is 21."

"Got a good job? I cost thousands of dollars each year," says another, which adds that teen parents should expect to spend more than $10,000 a year to raise their child.

"Teens giving birth before they are ready to provide emotional and financial support is not a good way to raise children," said Administration Commissioner Robert Doar. "We cannot dictate how people live their lives, and sometimes even the best plans don't work out, but we must encourage responsibility and send the right message, especially to young people."

Planned Parenthood, an advocacy group and provider of reproductive health services and education, said Wednesday in a statement that the ads propagate stereotypes and fail to address the societal problems that lead to teen pregnancies.

A city spokeswoman defended the ads, calling them but one part of a larger initiative that will include an interactive texting and social media campaign and a YouTube video public service announcement.

"This campaign is part of the city's comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention program, which includes sex education, increased access to birth control and partnerships with community-based organizations," said Samantha Levine, deputy press secretary for Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The city runs a school-based education program in which teen mothers and fathers discuss with peers the challenges of raising a child. A state-run family planning benefit program covers reproductive and sexual health care, including contraceptives, to low-income teens and adults.

And a citywide relationship abuse prevention program lays out the consequences of teen pregnancy and how to avoid peer pressure and coercion.

Since 2011, the city has mandated comprehensive sex education in public schools.

The city's pregnancy rate for females has dropped by 27% over the past decade, but it is still higher than the national average, according to the mayor's office, which launched the campaign on Monday.

"Daughters of teen parents are more likely to become teen mothers themselves, while sons are more likely to go to prison," it said in a statement. "On the other hand, parents who finish high school, find full- time work and get married before having children have a 98% chance of not living in poverty."

Planned Parenthood said that it supports the initiatives and recognizes the importance of awareness and education, but added that the rate of teen pregnancies is affected by economic and societal factors such as poverty, violence, limited access to health care, as well as gender, racial and ethnic inequalities.

"Teenage parenthood is simply not the disastrous and life-compromising event these ads portray," it said. "It's time we focus on the root causes rather than point fingers at teen parents and their children."

Last year, Bloomberg pledged a $250,000 matching gift to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America after the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation cut off grants to Planned Parenthood for breast cancer screenings. The foundation later reversed its decision.

According to data compiled by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy in its 2012 publication, "Why It Matters: Teen Childbearing, Education, and Economic Wellbeing," roughly 48% of mothers ages 15 to 19 lived below the poverty line.

As their children grow up, their likelihood of living in poverty increases according to Jessica Sheets Pika, a spokeswoman for the organization.

Some 41% of women who gave birth before 20 were living in poverty within the first year of their child's birth, while the chances of living in poverty rose to 50% when their child reached 3, Pika said.
The Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Thursday that human genes cannot be patented.

But in something of a compromise, all nine justices said while the naturally occurring isolated biological material itself is not patentable, a synthetic version of the gene material may be patented.

Legal and medical experts believe the decision will have a lasting impact on genetic testing, likely making varieties more widely available and more affordable.

The overriding legal question addressed was whether "products of nature" can be treated the same as "human-made" inventions, allowing them to be held as the exclusive intellectual property of individuals and companies.

The broader issue involved 21st century conflicts over cutting-edge medical science, the power of business and individual legal rights, and how their convergence might influcence decisionmaking over how people and medicine manage the prospect and reality of certain diseases, like cancer.

The issue has deeply divided the scientific and business communities. But it was a blockbuster celebrity, actress Angelina Jolie who brought it to the public in announcing last month that she underwent a double mastectomy following a genetic test.

The Supreme Court case involves Myriad Genetics, a Utah-based company that was sued over its claim of patents relating to two types of biological material that it identified -- BRCA1 and BRCA2, whose mutations are linked to increased hereditary risk for breast and ovarian cancer.

Since Myriad owns the patent on breast cancer genes, it was the only company that could perform tests for potential abnormalities.

It says 1 million patients have benefited from its "BRAC Analysis" technology, and that about 250,000 such tests are performed yearly.

An initial test catches most problems, but the company also offers a second called BART to detect the rest, a diagnostic that can cost several thousand dollars.

Jolie had Myriad's breast cancer test.

Plaintiffs and testing

Among those challenging the Myriad patents were sisters Eileen Kelly and Kathleen Maxian. Kelly was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40.

The initial BRCA test proved negative, meaning her family members were not likely at risk. But Maxian later developed ovarian cancer. The second BART testing proved positive, meaning the siblings carried the cancer-causing mutation all along.

Money was not an issue for them, but Kelly and Maxian, along with a coalition of physician groups and genetic counselors say Myriad has not made the BART tests widely available for patients without a strong family history of these kinds of cancers.

Breast cancer survivor Lisbeth Ceriani was another plaintiff. She faced having to pay thousands for Myriad's test to see if she had a mutation for ovarian cancer. Because of cost, she waited 18 months before she could afford it, learning she carried a mutation, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented plaintiffs.

All sides agree the science of isolating the building blocks of life is no easy task. Myriad has said it has spent several years and hundreds of millions of dollars in its research. But the issue of patenting has divided the scientific and business communities.

A history of patent protection

In the past 31 years, 20 percent of the human genome has been protected under U.S. patents.

On one side of the Myriad case, scientists and companies argued patents encourage medical innovation and investment that saves lives.

On the other, patient rights groups and civil libertarians countered the patent holders were "holding hostage" the diagnostic care and access of information available to high-risk patients.

Outside the court during oral arguments in April, several protesters held signs, such as "Your corporate greed is killing my friends" and "My genes are not property."

The patent system was created more than two centuries ago with a dual purpose. One is to offer temporary financial incentives for those at the ground floor of innovative products like the combustible engine and the X-ray machine.

The second is to ensure one company does not hold a lifetime monopoly that might discourage competition and consumer affordability.

All patent submissions rely on a complex reading of applicable laws, distinguishing between abstract ideas and principles, and more tangible scientific discoveries and principles.

The Supreme Court ruling

The Supreme Court has long allowed patent protection for the creation of a new process or use for natural products. Whether "isolating" or "extracting" genes themselves qualifies for such protection became the central argument.

The justices took the position offered by the Obama administration -- DNA itself is not patentable but so-called "cDNA" can be.

Complementary DNA is artificially synthesized from the genetic template, and engineered to produce gene clones.

Use of this protein-isolating procedure, known as "tagging," is especially important in mapping and cataloguing the vast human genome.

"Genes and the information they encode are not patent-eligible under [federal law] simply because they have been isolated from the surrounding genetic material," said Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the 9-0 court opinion.

"Myriad did not create anything," said Thomas. "To be sure, it found an important and useful gene, but separating that gene from its surrounding genetic material is not an act of invention."

But Thomas said, "cDNA does not present the same obstacles to patentability as naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments."

Reaction to the decision

The American Civil Liberties Union said the decision represents a major shift in patent law and overturns established policy.

"Today, the court struck down a major barrier to patient care and medical innovation," said Sandra Park, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Women's Rights Project. "Myriad did not invent the BRCA genes and should not control them. Because of this ruling, patients will have greater access to genetic testing and scientists can engage in research on these genes without fear of being sued."

Dr. Harry Ostrer, a professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and director of genetic and genomic testing at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, said the decision will not undermine the genetically engineered drug industry and expects the costs of tests to fall.

"I'm thrilled. We can offer BRCA 1 and 2 testing to low-income women without concerns about how it will be paid for," he said.

Jolie also hoped for a meaningful impact.

"I hope that this ruling will lead to more women at risk of breast cancer being able to get access to gene testing and to take control of their lives, not just in the U.S. but around the world -- whatever their means and whatever their background," she said.

Peter D. Meldrum, president and chief executive officer of Myriad, said in a statement  the company believed the court "appropriately upheld our claims on cDNA"

The ruling, he added "underscored the patent eligibility of our method claims, ensuring strong intellectual property protection for our BRACAnalysis test moving forward."

Investors in Myriad were pleased with the ruling with the stock soaring as much as 9% before settling back but still higher.

The case is Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (12-398).

(CNN) -- Iran executed a man in a rare public hanging in Tehran on Wednesday morning, local media reported.

The man, identified only as "Yaqub," was convicted of stabbing a man to death in broad daylight in October, said the official Islamic Republic News Agency.

The public hanging, which was attended by the victims' family and large crowds of onlookers, took place in the main square of the affluent northern Tehran neighborhood of Sa'adat Abad.

The October murder sparked outrage amongst Tehran residents after videos of the stabbing surfaced on the Internet and were replayed on Iranian state television. The killing took place in front of two police officers, the news agency said.

Although executions are common in Iran, public ones are not.

A death sentence can be handed down for crimes from murder to adultery.

The latest execution brings the total number this year to 20, according to a CNN count from local media reports.

On Monday, Iranian authorities hanged seven convicted drug traffickers in the city of Kermanshah, the news agency said.

Amnesty International says Iran only trails China in the number of executions worldwide.

(CNN) -- Three officials in a Los Angeles suburb whose high salaries sparked statewide outrage will step down from their jobs, the city's mayor said Friday.

Oscar Hernandez, the mayor of Bell, California, said the City Council accepted the resignations of City Manager Robert Rizzo, Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia, and Police Chief Randy Adams, who reportedly had a combined salary of more than $1.6 million. He added that the three will not get severance pay.

"Today, our city council took the quick and decisive action that is in the best interest of our city so that we may return our attention to delivering outstanding city services," the mayor said in a statement posted on the city clerk's website.

"We recognize that today's economic climate and the financial hardships so many families are suffering put our past compensation decisions in a new light. To the residents of Bell, we apologize. We are confident that your pride in our great city endures and that the city's financial health and superior public services demonstrate that our priorities remain intact."

But Hernandez also praised Rizzo and called the Los Angeles Times story and the resulting uproar that led to the resignations "unfair and unwarranted."

The salaries have infuriated many in California.

Jerry Brown, California's attorney general, issued a statement Thursday saying that his office had launched a investigation into the salaries.

The Los Angeles Times reported that Rizzo had an annual salary of nearly $800,000 a year, "making him the highest-paid city manager in the state."

Citing the newspaper, Brown's statement said Adams had an annual salary of $457,000 and Spaccia received $376,288 a year.

"Most city council members are paid nearly $100,000 for their part-time jobs," the attorney general said.

"These outrageous salaries in Bell are shocking and beyond belief," he said. "With record deficits and painful budget cuts facing California cities, astronomical local government salaries raise serious questions and demand a thorough investigation."

"It's shocking. How did they get it?" Cory Christ, a resident of the city, said to CNN affiliate KTLA. "They're making more than the president -- it's totally not fair,"

California Assemblyman Hector De La Torre, who represents the district that encompasses Bell, also voiced outrage.

"The city council salaries and the outrageous salaries for the staff have really riled up the community," he told CNN recently. "... It's a working class community. They're busy just trying to survive in this tough economic climate."

De La Torre said the median yearly income in the southern California town is under $35,000 a year.

"Just to put it in context, the general fund for the city of Bell is $15 million. So, Mr. Rizzo with his salary and compensation package, around $800,000 is about one-fifteenth of the budget for the city of Bell," De La Torre said.

"And Mr. Rizzo is obviously a little delusional about what the private sector would be (able) to pay anybody, certainly not $800,000. Certainly not double what the president of the United States" makes.

In his statement, Hernandez said the Times' "coverage and the contrived uproar the Times sought to provoke are unfair and unwarranted" and praised Rizzo.

Hernandez said the salaries "have been in line with similar positions over the period of their tenure" and that Rizzo gave the town 15 years of balanced budgets after a $20 million shortfall.

"While other cities are defaulting on their commitments, borrowing to maintain city services or even threatening bankruptcy, Bell has a healthy surplus that has enabled us to ride out the nation's fiscal storm and even expand services to meet the growing needs of our low-income residents through the city food bank and programs for youth and seniors.

"While other municipalities are shuttering their libraries and shutting down their parks and services, Bell's parents know their children have access to services and activities that keep them safe -- especially during the summer months when school is out and working parents are not at home during the day."

Hernandez appointed Pedro Carrillo, assistant to the city manager, to be the interim city manager.

"We acknowledge that the actions taken today are not a panacea, but a first step towards healing our city and getting back to business that ensures the safety and well-being of our residents," the mayor said.
TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Sony blamed the global economic slowdown, increased competition and an appreciating yen for a 95 percent drop in third-quarter profits, as the company announced its results Thursday.

Customers check Sony's Bravia brand LCD TVs at an electronics shop in Tokyo, Japan.

Profits for the quarter, which ended December 31, fell from nearly 200 billion yen ($2.2 billion) in 2007 to about 10 billion yen ($110 million) in 2008.

Across the company, sales were down 25 percent, but electronics and games sales were especially hard hit.

Sales of games, including the company's popular PlayStation series, fell 32 percent over the year. Sales of electronics decreased by nearly 30 percent.

The appreciation of the yen also cut into profits.

A stronger yen makes Japanese products more expensive or forces companies to lower their profit margins to keep prices the same.

Last week, Sony warned that it will close out the fiscal year, which ends March 31, with an operating loss of 260 billion yen ($2.9 billion), its first in 14 years.  Watch what lies ahead for Sony »
(CNN) -- The French season is already up and running and over the weekend the English Premier League returned to action, while Spanish clubs continue to prepare for the start of La Liga on 23 August. So who were the weekend's winners and losers?

Winners

Liverpool

No Luis Suarez? No problem for Liverpool. In a tight Premier League opener against Southampton, the attacking talents who still remain at Anfield proved last season's runners-up still have bite, despite the departure of English football's least favorite Uruguayan.

Big things are expected of livewire Raheem Sterling and the England starlet continued the electrifying form he displayed at the end of last season. Latching onto a perfect Jordan Henderson through ball in the first half, he produced a calm finish to open the scoring.

But after Southampton equalized in the second half, it was Suarez's former strike partner Daniel Sturridge who made the decisive contribution.

One half of the "SAS" duo that was so prolific last term, Sturridge steered home Sterling's 79th-minute header to ensure Brendan Rodgers' team opened with a 2-1 win.

Playing in just his 50th match for Liverpool, Sturridge scored his 36th goal. If Sturridge and Sterling keep firing, memories of Suarez will fade fast.

"Vanishing spray"

Consisting of 80% water and 17% butane gas, it's an unlikely football icon.

But on its Premier League debut, "vanishing spray" was cheered to the rafters by supporters the length and breadth of England.

Used to great success at the 2014 World Cup, having long been a staple of South American football, the foamy substance is sprayed by referees to position players at set pieces.

English football is a late adopter of the pocket-sized innovation, but the country's fans whooped and hollered like cavemen playing with a lighter every time a referee grabbed the canister from his waistband.

Not everyone is convinced, though. Arsenal's Santi Cazorla swallowed a mouthful of the stuff after referee Jonathan Moss suffered a nozzle malfunction.

It might be hard for the Spaniard to stomach, but it looks like "vanishing spray" is here to stay.

Cristiano Ronaldo

The craze which has swept through the United States has made its way into football and, even though he didn't kick a ball this weekend, Cristiano Ronaldo rounds up our list of winners.

The Real Madrid star became the latest footballer to brave the "ice bucket challenge," which began in North America as a way of raising money for the degenerative condition Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Motor Neurone Disease.

A host of celebrities have soaked themselves in icy cold water, and Ronaldo joined the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Justin Timberlake and Conan O'Brien after being nominated by former Manchester United teammate Darren Fletcher.

Sat in a tiny purple speedo, Ronaldo nominated rapper Little Wayne as well as Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez before being drenched by fellow Portugal international Fabio Coentrao.

Over to you, J'Lo...

Losers

Manchester United

How misleading can six pre-season wins be? Manchester United's 2-1 home defeat by Swansea on Saturday showed there will be no easy fixes for new manager Louis van Gaal.

The Dutch "mad genius" quickly had to rethink his 3-5-2 formation as Swansea exposed manifest weaknesses in United's defence, while comfortably dealing with their ponderous midfield and stuttering attack.

More worryingly Saturday's defeat highlighted the lack of investment in United's squad over the last few years, a legacy bequeathed to former manager David Moyes by his predecessor Alex Ferguson.

The club's owners have spared no effort in lining up myriad global sponsors --- official noodle and paint partners to name but two --- so it's a shame more hasn't been done to identify and rectify deficiencies in the playing staff.

Chief executive Ed Woodward has a matter of days left in the transfer window to improve United's strength in depth but his track record of success --- or arguable lack of -- in bringing in new players is increasingly coming under the spotlight.

Monaco

Have Monaco lost their mojo? After finishing second last season, Monaco is without a point after two games and Sunday's 4-1 defeat at Bordeaux illustrates Ligue 1's noveau riche club might struggle without James Rodriguez, who joined Real Madrid in the summer.

Two of those four goals came from penalties, which prompted Monaco's new coach Leonardo Jardim to point the finger at referee Tony Chapron as a key factor in his side's defeat.

"We had two refereeing errors that sealed the match and after that there's been no game. We must continue to work - we will continue to believe in these players," Jardim told reporters.

There was some good news for Jardim and Monaco in that Colombian international Radamel Falcao came on as a second substitute as he returns from the serious knee injury that ruled him out of the World Cup.

Brandao

Elsewhere in France, Bastia's Brazilian striker Brandao could be in all sorts of trouble after the Corsican club's 2-0 defeat by champions Paris Saint-Germain.

Thiago Motta suffered a broken nose after the game with CCTV cameras in the Parc des Princes tunnel showing Brandao waiting for the Italian international before the Bastia forward headbutted the PSG midfielder.

French secretary of state for sports Thierry Braillard told Franco Info the headbutt was "scandalous" and "unacceptable" and "merited a sanction."

PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi went further, telling Canal Plus TV after the game that Brandao should be "suspended for life... he is not a football player."

France's Professional Football League disciplinary committee is due to examine the incident on Thursday and, given the severity of the "biting" sanction handed out to Luis Suarez by world governing body FIFA, it will be interesting to what the French regulator does.

That wasn't Brandao's only impact on the match with PSG saying their Dutch defender Gregory Van der Wiel suffered "a fracture of the second lumbar vertebra" following a knee in the back in the first half."

Last season Brandao was suspended for four matches after elbowing PSG's Yohan Cabaye at the Parc des Princes while playing for Saint-Etienne.
HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Talks among regional African leaders failed Monday to resolve a long-standing power-sharing dispute between embattled Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.

South African former president Thabo Mbeki is shown at talks Monday in Harare.

After the meeting a visibly angry Mugabe said talks faltered after Tsvangirai, head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), presented proposals which differed from recommendations by the 15-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC).

"The talks did not go very well. ... MDC have a proposal which is in conflict with the SADC and we opposed it and then the talks broke down," Mugabe said. "We will continue with discussions here at home. We shall continue to exchange ideas and see where the differences are with the SADC proposal."

The meeting had drawn the leaders of Mozambique and South Africa, as well as former South African President Thabo Mbeki.

In light of the continued stalemate, SADC executive secretary Tomaz Salamao told journalists that South African leader Kgalema Motlanthe, who is leading the SADC, had called for a summit on January 26. The meeting will be held in Botswana or South Africa.

Tsvangirai blamed Mugabe for the failure of the talks.

"For us as the MDC this is probably the darkest day of our lives," Tsvangirai told reporters as he left the hotel where the 12-hour-long meeting took place. "I am sure the whole nation is waiting anxiously for the resolution of this crisis. We are committed to this deal but subject to (ruling party) ZANU-PF conceding on these issues."

Mugabe told the state media that Monday's meeting would be the final one, and that he would form a government without the opposition if no agreement was reached.

The MDC has not been able to settle with Mugabe since signing a power sharing deal in September. Tsvangirai accuses Mugabe of keeping the most powerful portfolios in the government for his party. The ministries under contention include home affairs, finance, foreign affairs, local government, information and defense.

Both Tsvangirai and Mugabe, along with Arthur Mutambara of a small faction of the MDC, are expected to attend next week's summit, Salamao said.

The power-sharing deal is expected to keep Zimbabwe's melting economy from a total collapse. Zimbabwe is experiencing its worst economic and humanitarian crisis, with the highest inflation in the world officially at 231 million percent as of July 2008.

Analysts say the inflation is thriving because of an acute shortage of all essentials ranging from fuel, electricity, cash and food. The United Nations estimates that about 5 million people in Zimbabwe need urgent food aid.

A cholera epidemic has claimed more than 2,200 lives since its outbreak in August. The ravaging cholera has been made worse by a four-months-long industrial action by doctors and nurses demanding higher pay.
(CNN) -- The flight data and cockpit voice recorders from JetBlue Flight 191, which made an emergency landing this week, have been retrieved and will be analyzed, officials said Thursday.

The National Transportation Safety Board will download the data Friday, said spokeswoman Kelly Nantel. Information gleaned from them will be given to the FBI, she said.

Investigators are looking into the apparent midair meltdown of the captain, Clayton Osbon, whose remarks and erratic behavior Tuesday led the co-pilot to lock him out of the cockpit.

Crew and passengers subdued Osbon as he screamed and banged on the door so hard the first officer thought Osbon would come through, according to a federal criminal complaint filed Wednesday against Osbon.

The complaint says Osbon began making remarks during the flight that concerned the first officer, who is his co-pilot.

"Osbon yelled over the radio to air traffic control and instructed them to be quiet. Osbon turned off the radios in the aircraft, dimmed his monitors and sternly admonished the FO (first officer) for trying to talk on the radio," the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of Texas said in a written statement. "When Osbon said 'we need to take a leap of faith,' the FO stated that he became very worried. Osbon told the FO that 'we're not going to Vegas,' and began giving what the FO described as a sermon."

It was not immediately known whether the alleged remarks are audible on the voice recorder. But federal regulations state that planes manufactured since 1991 must record cockpit chatter on microphones. The JetBlue plane was new and would be subject to the rule.

The cockpit voice recorder captures two hours of data and the flight data recorder, which measures the plane's speed and altitude, contains 25 hours.

About 3Â½ hours into the planned five-hour flight from New York's Kennedy International Airport to Las Vegas, the pilot left the cockpit to use the lavatory, but he failed to follow security protocol, alarming the crew, according to an affidavit filed in support of an arrest warrant. He then banged on the lavatory door and told the female passenger inside that he needed to go to the bathroom.

By that time, the first officer had summoned another JetBlue pilot who had been traveling as a passenger to enter the cockpit and the two locked themselves inside, the affidavit states.

From the cabin, Osbon tried to enter his security code to gain access to the cockpit "and he banged on the door hard enough that the FO thought he was coming through the door," according to the affidavit. But the door held and, over the PA, the first officer ordered passengers to restrain Osbon. Several did just that, subduing the pilot in the forward galley.

Osbon, who was been charged with interfering with a flight crew, has not made a public statement. He has been suspended pending an investigation and is receiving medical treatment, the airline said Wednesday. A court official said Osbon was still under care Thursday.

JetBlue has repeatedly praised the first officer, along with an off-duty captain who stepped in to assist and other crew members.

Some passengers have referred to the first officer as a hero. But his mother said on Thursday that he would reject the label.

"Knowing my son, he would think that he's not a hero. He just did what he was paid to do," Jean Beatrice Dowd said of Jason Dowd.

"That's just his job, and he loves his job. He's just a quiet man."

He called his parents the night of the incident, his mother said. "He was pretty shaken up, and he couldn't say much."

The incident took place on a significant date for the family -- the 10th anniversary of the death of Jason Dowd's older sister, who died of cancer, Jean Dowd said.

"I know he was thinking of her, too, at the time this was all going on," Dowd said.

The incident "has been earthshaking for us, too," she said. "To lose him would have been terrible for us."

Jason Dowd, 41, who is married and has two young children, has not made a public statement. He was in New York, speaking with officials about the incident, his mother said.

After the incident, the flight made the emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas.

Osbon's stepmother said Thursday she has flown with him several times.

"He loved to fly, a love which he got from his dad," Judy Osbon said in a statement. "He also took his piloting very seriously and was very good at it. I've only known Clayton to be a cheerful, conscientious and caring person."

Her stepson was upbeat the last time they spoke, she said.

Osbon's father, Ronald, who was a pilot, and a passenger were killed in a 1995 airplane crash in Florida, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The pilot radioed he was losing power on both engines and was out of gas. The aircraft crashed near Daytona Beach Regional Airport.

CNN's Aaron Cooper, Mike M. Ahlers and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.
Is it an act of compassion or one of belligerence?

Both judgments were offered Friday on the dozens of Russian trucks that have rolled into eastern Ukraine, a move Russian leaders cast as necessary to address a humanitarian crisis and a Ukrainian official characterized as an "invasion" of his nation by its mighty neighbor to the east.

While getting agreement on the right answer is impossible at this moment, there's little doubt the actions have raised tensions to new levels -- and that's saying something, given the volatility over the past many months.

The latest row revolves around aid going from Russia to Ukraine. Kiev had stalled trucks on the Russian side of the border for days, before acknowledging Sunday that the convoy, in fact, had humanitarian aid.

That admission didn't end the discord and debate. As of 11:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) Friday, 227 Russian vehicles had crossed into Ukraine, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has an observer mission at the checkpoint the convoy went through.

All the vehicles were supposed to be monitored by members of the International Committee of the Red Cross. However, the Red Cross said it wasn't accompanying them due to the "volatile security situation" -- a reference to continued fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian forces.

Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of directly and indirectly bolstering the rebel movement. The Kiev-based government and its allies -- including the NATO alliance and its core member, the United States -- see this convoy as perhaps Moscow's most glaring, egregious move yet.

"We call this a direct invasion for the first time under cynical cover of the Red Cross," said Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine's security service.

Right now, Ukraine isn't planning to go after the convoy. Still, Nalyvaychenko thinks its main purpose is to supply rebels and its drivers are not even civilians.

To Russian President Vladimir Putin, it is Ukraine's government -- not his -- that's being irresponsible and fueling instability in eastern Ukraine.

Putin expressed "serious concern" to German Chancellor Angela Merkel about endangered civilians and other impacts from Ukraine's "continued (military) escalation," according to the Kremlin.

He further criticized what he characterized as "Kiev's blatant attempts to hinder the delivery of Russian humanitarian aid" into southeast Ukraine, implying he had no choice but to act.

"Further delay would have been unacceptable," a Kremlin statement said.

U.S. official warns Russia on convoys

The international community hardly embraced Putin's version of events.

The British ambassador to the United Nations said that Russia had no support at a U.N. Security Council meeting Friday on the topic. The diplomat, Mark Lyall Grant, made no doubt about his own country's views on the convoy's entrance into Ukraine.

"It is an undeniable and blatant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and clear breach of international law and the U.N. charter," Lyall Grant told reporters. "It has nothing to do with humanitarianism."

NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned that the the "so-called humanitarian convoy ... can only deepen the crisis in the region, which Russia itself has created and has continued to fuel."

"The disregard of international humanitarian principles raises further questions about whether the true purpose of the aid convoy is to support civilians or to resupply armed separatists," Rasmussen said in a statement.

Merkel talked not only with Putin -- during which she voiced her "grave concern" -- but also with U.S. President Barack Obama.

The two leaders agreed that Ukraine "has continued to deteriorate since the tragic downing" of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, purportedly by pro-Russian rebels, the White House said. The pair concurred, too, that the convoy "is a further provocation and a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty" and called for the stop "of Russian personnel, military equipment and armored vehicles into eastern Ukraine."

Other U.S. officials laid into Russia publicly.

Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said that Moscow has been told in "very, very clear (terms) that they should not be doing this under the guise of a humanitarian convoy, to use that as an excuse to cross the border in a non-authorized way."

"Russia must remove its vehicles and its personnel from the territory of Ukraine immediately," Kirby told reporters. "Failure to do so will result in additional costs and isolation."

This view was seconded by Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, who deemed the convoy -- which he said his nation and its allies are tracking closely -- "as part of a pattern of flagrant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty." The more Moscow does such things that stir instability in Ukraine, the more it will pay, according to Rhodes.

"If (Russia does) not remove the convoys, we will be making determinations with our international partners about how to ratchet up the costs and consequences on them," Rhodes said.

U.S. official: Up to 18,000 Russian troops on border

It's not just the Russian vehicles that crossed into Ukraine that are causing consternation. So, too, are the Russian troops massed at the border.

There were up to 18,000 such "combat-ready" troops on Friday, a significant increase from previous public estimates by the Pentagon, according to a U.S. defense official with direct access to the latest information.

The official described the units as being in a "fully combat-capable offensive posture."

A second U.S. official said that many of the units were positioned at "crossroads and towns" two to 10 miles from the border.

"They are definitely more overt, aggressive and out in the open," the official said. "They aren't even hiding it."

The second official said the United States has believed for weeks that some Russian troops have crossed the border as part of the convoys of military gear and weapons moving from Russia into Ukraine.

Of particular concern is the apparent transport of long-range and advanced systems including at least two SA-22 surface-to-air missile system and a number of pieces of longer-range artillery.

The fear is that any advance of any kind could make the ongoing fighting -- sparked last year by a political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or Russia -- even worse. U.N. officials estimate that more than 2,000 people have died and nearly 5,000 have been wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April.

The dead include Mykola Zelenec, Lithuania's honor consul in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk, who Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said had been "kidnapped and brutally killed by terrorists."

Ukraine has time and again accused Russia of effectively fomenting rebellion by supporting rebels -- including militarily -- in eastern Ukraine, some of whom continue to hold territory there despite a push by Ukraine's military.

Russia has denied any direct support for the rebels while voicing sympathy for their fight for self-determination, saying that Kiev is in the wrong for its actions that endanger civilians -- including many ethnic Russians.

Even if the Russian military doesn't explicitly march into Ukraine, there are concerns that it will find other ways to bolster the rebels.

Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, insisted Friday that the current humanitarian convoy won't be one of them.

He told reporters that Russia received "official acceptance by Kiev authorities" for the convoy, and that Moscow is staying in touch with Ukrainian officials to make sure there are no problems in the process of distribution of the aid.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Justice Department on Thursday announced 300 additional arrests in a four-year operation that it says produced nearly 1,200 arrests and seizures totaling 11.7 tons of illegal drugs.

Authorities look through seized property after a drug raid at a house near Atlanta, Georgia, on Wednesday.

Attorney General Eric Holder announced the wrap-up of Project Coronado, which resulted in arrests in 15 states in the past two days.

Holder said the operation targeted the distribution network of a major Mexican drug trafficking organization known as La Familia. About 3,000 federal agents participated in the investigation and raids, officials said.

"This unprecedented, coordinated U.S. law enforcement action -- the largest ever undertaken against a Mexican drug cartel -- has dealt a significant blow to La Familia's supply chain of illegal drugs, weapons and cash flowing between Mexico and the United States," Holder said in a news conference.  Watch Holder announce the arrests »

Michele Leonhart, acting chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration, said the cartel was known for specializing in the trafficking of methamphetamine and for its brutal violence, including beheadings.

Authorities said the arrests made Wednesday and Thursday occurred in California, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington.

Dozens of arrests occurred in the Dallas, Texas, area where agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives filed charges against cartel members believed to have illegally purchased and shipped high-powered firearms to the cartel, which was based in the Mexican state of Michoacan.

U.S. officials vowed to indict cartel leaders and extradite them to the United States. One leader, Servando Gomez-Martinez, was indicted in New York on Thursday. He remains at large, and is presumed to be in Mexico.

A senior law enforcement official involved in the operation, who asked not to be identified, said he was certain the latest crackdown on La Familia would affect the methamphetamine market in the United States for months. "It'll make a difference not only because of how hard we hit 'em, but where we hit 'em," the official said.

Another official said during the course of the investigation that labs run by La Familia had been discovered in Atlanta, Georgia, and San Jose, California.

To date, Project Coronado has led to 1,186 arrests in 44 months. During that time, agents seized $32.8 million in U.S. currency, and about 1,225 kilograms (2,700 pounds) of methamphetamine, 2,000 kilograms (4,409 pounds) of cocaine, 13 kilograms (29 pounds) of heroin and more than 8 tons (7,200 kilograms) of marijuana.
LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- For Miley Cyrus, star of Disney's popular television series "Hannah Montana" and its big-screen adaptation "Hannah Montana: The Movie," art is not far from real life.

Miley Cyrus, here in "Hannah Montana: The Movie," says filming in Tennessee was relaxing.

The 16-year-old actress and singer reconnected with her Southern roots for the filming of "Hannah Montana: The Movie." Traveling to Tennessee to shoot the movie, Cyrus said, helped keep her grounded.

"It actually gave me time to relax, and it was when my career was just starting to take off ... when I was just starting to travel," Cyrus said. "It was at a time when I needed to go back home and it couldn't have been more of a perfect time."

In the film, opening in theaters Friday, Cyrus plays Miley Stewart, a typical teenage girl who lives a double life as a famous pop star named Hannah Montana. Eventually, Hannah begins taking over Miley's life, leading Miley to take a soul-searching journey back home to decide what she really wants: notoriety or normality.

Miley shares the screen with her father, country musician Billy Ray Cyrus, who felt that a trip home would be beneficial to his daughter.  Watch Miley and Billy Ray discuss the film »

"This is definitely an example of art imitating life imitating art. ... It's so important to be aware of where you're at and be focused on where you're going but, more importantly, never forget where you came from," the elder Cyrus said. "You can't fake going home. That was her home."

Both on-screen and off, Miley said, she and her father share a close friendship, calling herself a "daddy's girl 100 percent."

Between the endless tabloid headlines and the paparazzi's persistence, keeping friends and family near at hand, Miley said, helps remind her of who she really is: "I think just have good friends, good family and a good team. That's what people miss the most, just having a good team."

Co-star Lucas Till, who plays Miley's love interest in the film, remarked on Miley's down-to-earth personality.

"She's really nice and really [endearing], and she really cares about people," he said. "She's a good friend, very loyal."

The two shared an on-screen kiss that, Till said, "could have been more meaningful."  Watch Till talk about kissing Cyrus »

"There was a lot more there to that kiss than you see," he said.

Asked whether Till was a good kisser, Miley replied, "Meh, he's OK. No, I'm just kidding. I don't know. I think I was too busy thinking about my next line to think about it."

During her film's opening weekend, Miley is planning on surprising select audiences at undisclosed theater locations across the country. Moviegoers who see "Hannah Montana: The Movie" this weekend could also be treated to surprise appearances by stars of the film, live performances and more.

Miley said she was excited to give back to her fans. "I have the best fans in the world," she said.

After playing "Hannah" for three years, Miley said, she's not ready to quit anytime soon.

"I can't be Hannah until I'm 30, but I want to keep doing it as long as possible," she said.

MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Passengers said they saw flames and then heard an explosion moments before a Spanair jet crashed on takeoff Wednesday at Madrid's Barajas Airport, killing 153 people, according to local media.

The Spanair Flight JK5022 was carrying 172 people. There were 19 survivors, including two infants, Development Minister Magdalena Alvarez said.

The 19 were being treated at a hospital, Alvaraez said.

The severity of the injuries varies, but many of the injured have been treated for burns, Spanish Red Cross spokeswoman Olivia Acosa said.  Watch as the wounded arrive at a hospital »

The flight was bound for Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, two hours away.

Local officials said one of the engines caught fire. The aircraft, an MD-82, has two jet engines, both at the rear.

The burning plane came to rest in a gully about 2:45 p.m. (8:45 a.m. ET).

The crash sent up a plume of smoke visible from several kilometers away. At the time of the crash, weather conditions were hot and clear.  Watch smoke rising from airport »

A survivor told Spain's ABC newspaper that she and other passengers heard an explosion as the plane was taking off. iReport: Send us your pictures, video, information.

"She said they could see the fire, ... and then it was not even a minute or so they heard [something] blow up," reporter Carlota Fomina told CNN. "They were about 200 meters [660 feet] in the air, and then they were landing but not crashing. They were landing, like, little by little; it was not like they [fell] down suddenly."

The MD-82 was carrying 162 passengers, four non-working crew members and six working crew members, Spanair said. After contacting families, the airline published the names of those aboard on its Web site.  Watch as relatives of survivors start arriving at the airport »

Some of the survivors have serious injuries, while others have non-life-threatening injuries. Many of the injured were treated for burns, she said.

The aircraft was carrying seven passengers from Lufthansa Flight 2554, according to the airline. Spanair, a low-cost airline that has a flight-sharing agreement with Lufthansa, is owned by SAS Scandinavian Airlines.

Barajas Airport closed after the crash but reopened more than two hours later, allowing a limited number of takeoffs and landings, an airport official said.  See a map of the airport »

Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero arrived at the airport Wednesday evening after cutting short a vacation.

"The government will do all it can to support the families in this difficult situation," he said. "The whole government, logically, is affected, very affected, as are all Spanish citizens, by this tragedy."

The fatal crash was the first at the airport since December 1983, when 93 people were killed as two Spanish airliners collided.

The airport, eight miles (13 km) northeast of central Madrid, is Spain's busiest, handling more than 40 million passengers a year.

The United States National Transportation Safety Board is sending an investigation team to Madrid because the aircraft is American-made, NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said.

Spanair has set up a local emergency number for family members and friends phoning from Spain: +34 800-400-200.

(CNN) -- There won't just be a new winner next season on "American Idol." Most everything about the show may be new.

Weeks after Randy Jackson announced his departure from Fox's long-running music talent show, two of his fellow judges -- Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj -- followed him out the door Thursday.

That leaves only one "Idol" judge left in crooner Keith Urban -- for now.

News of Carey's departure came out first Thursday, in the form of a tweet posted on her official account that stated she was saying "goodbye 2 idol" (and, simultaneously, announced a new world tour). Players behind "American Idol" -- namely Fox, FremantleMedia and 19 Entertainment -- confirmed her departure in a statement.

"Mariah Carey is a true global icon -- one of the most accomplished artists on the planet -- and we feel extremely fortunate that she was able to bring her wisdom and experience to the 'American Idol' contestants this season," they said. "We know she will remain an inspiration to 'Idol' hopefuls for many seasons to come."

Minaj followed up a short time later with a tweet of her own, making her exit official, also after a lone season.

"Thank you American Idol for a life changing experience! Wouldn't trade it for the world!" the rapper wrote. "Time to focus on the Music!!! Mmmuuuaahhh!!!"

After this tweet, Fox, FreemantleMedia and 19 Entertainment issued another statement saying they "understand and respect her decision" in light of "her extremely busy career."

"Nicki Minaj is a superstar who brought a level of honesty and passion to 'American Idol' and who had a tremendous positive impact on so many contestants this season," they said.

The two performers had been brought on following the exits of judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler, hoping to bolster the show's ratings.

"Idol" had topped the Nielsen charts as America's most watched program for eight years running. But that streak ended in 2012, and since then the show's producers have made several changes. This season's finale was earlier this month.

Carey and Minaj, though, ended up generating headlines more for their reported tiff than they did for bringing in more viewers.

Both of them join Jackson, who had been the only judge remaining from the program's 2002 debut. Earlier this month, he announced he had voted himself off the show.

"It's been a life-changing opportunity, but I am looking forward to focusing on my company, Dream Merchant 21, and other business ventures," the musician and producer said.
(CNN) -- Kei Nishikori made history as he became the first home player to capture the Japan Open after a three-set win over Milos Raonic Sunday.

The 22-year-old beat the Canadian 7-6 3-6 6-0 to win his second career title, but his first since Delray Beach in 2008.

"I cannot believe I won the tournament, but at the same time, I feel that I'm happy I was able to do this," he told the official ATP Tour website.

Nishikori, who beat second seed Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals, said he had gained renewed confidence from that victory after feeling the pressure of home expectation.

"I have not been able to play well in Japan until now, so I always thought perhaps I was not mentally strong enough to do so," Nishikori added.

"But the match against Berdych, something changed. I was able to play much better yesterday and today."

The 21-year-old Raonic, who put out defending champion Andy Murray in the semifinals, recovered to tie the match at one set all.

But in the decider he was broken early and never recovered as Nishikori clinched a famous victory.

Meanwhile in the final of the China Open in Beijing, top seed Novak Djokovic accounted for Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France 7-6 6-2 to claim his 32nd career crown.

The Serbian, who is challenging Roger Federer for the World No.1 spot, took just one hour 42 minutes to win his third straight title at the event.

Tsonga started strongly to break the favorite, but Djokovic retrieved it before winning the first set tiebreak.

The second set was more one-sided as Djokovic broke in the third game and repeated the trick to close out the victory.

In the accompanying WTA event, top seed and World No.1 Victoria Azarenka swept past second seed Maria Sharapova of Russia in straight sets in the final.

The Belarus star won 6-3 6-1 to claim a winning check for $848,000 as she took the China title at the fourth attempt.
Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The head of Libya's opposition government told reporters Saturday he welcomed a call Friday by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for Moammar Gadhafi to step down.

Medvedev's statement, echoing the stance of American and European leaders, appeared to indicate a closing diplomatic window for the longtime Libyan strongman.

The chairman of the National Transitional Council, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, said he has offered amnesty to Gadhafi loyalists who defect before the demise of the regime, but reiterated that there will be "no negotiation for any solution until Gadhafi's departure."

Once that happens, elections and a constitutional referendum will be held within a year, Jailil said in the opposition stronghold of Benghazi.

In an interview with CNN, Jalil said the council had sold a shipment of oil to China for $160 million. The confirmation of the sale is expected to buttress the political and economic credibility of the fledgling rebel power.

The leader said the movement has a "financial crisis" and is seeking loans from outside the country.

The council is happy for political support, but will not ask Russia for arms or economic aid, Jalil said.

The unrest in Libya has persisted for months as opposition members demand an end to Gadhafi's nearly 42-year rule.

Jalil marked the 100th day of the nation's civil war.

"We see victories emerging at both national and international levels," he said. "We should celebrate what our heroic sons have accomplished in Misrata and the Nafusa mountains, as well as applaud the wide international support for our revolution."

Meanwhile, a series of morning explosions rocked the capital of Tripoli on Saturday, including blasts at a compound belonging to Gadhafi and one at a nearby tribal compound, a government official said.

The official said one morning strike occurred on Bab bin Ghashir, a tribal compound near Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound, where the other strikes occurred. The official believed the strikes were NATO attacks.

No casualties were reported.

Morning strikes in Tripoli are rare. NATO confirmed one of the attacks -- a press officer said the strike on Bab bin Ghashir was timed to minimize civilian casualties.

NATO said it targeted a vehicle storage area at Bab bin Ghashir.

The tribal compound is used by people who volunteer as support forces for Libyan authorities. A decade ago, the site was used as a military station.

NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of any means -- with the exception of foreign occupation -- to protect civilians from attack or the threat of attack. It has been conducting airstrikes targeting Gadhafi's military resources.

Ahead of annual, routine military exercises between South Korea and the United States, North Korea issued its usual caustic objections Saturday.

It threatened "miserable destruction," if "your side ignites a war of aggression by staging the reckless joint military exercises ... at this dangerous time."

Though customary, the stark posturing by North Korea stands in the shadow of an underground nuclear test two weeks ago that was preceded by the launch of a long-range missile capable of transporting a warhead.

The detonation of the nuclear charge was the third in Pyongyang's history and the first under supreme leader Kim Jong Un's rule. South Korea's military reacted with fierce military drills, including a public display of newly deployed cruise missiles with pinpoint accuracy.

It has been on heightened readiness ever since.

The test also triggered a global wave of condemnation, including from Beijing, and plans for new sanctions against Pyongyang.

North Korea issued the objections to exercises Key Resolve and Foal Eagle scheduled for March and April to U.S. commander James D. Sherman, state run news agency KCNA reported.

The message was delivered over the phone in English, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported.

It also condemned the threat of new sanctions over North Korea's recent actions.

A United Nations military commission informed Pyongyang of the upcoming routine exercises, according to a joint statement from U.S. and South Korean military officials.

The commission also told North Korea that they are "not related with the current situations on the Korean Peninsula."

Around 10,000 U.S. forces will participate in Foal Eagle from March 1 to April 30.  Key Resolve will involve 10,000 South Korean troops and 3,500 U.S. troops in exercises March 11 to 21.

Key Resolve will include U.N. troops and neutral supervisors.
Hong Kong (CNN) -- Reports of Jade Rabbit's demise may have been premature.

China's first lunar rover had stopped functioning, state media reported Wednesday, but signs are emerging that Yutu, as it is known in Mandarin, may be up and running again.

Following technical malfunctions Xinhua said that the lunar rover had lost communication with mission control but on Thursday the state news agency said that the rover was "fully awake" and had returned to its normal signal-receiving status.

"Jade Rabbit has fully resurrected and is able to receive signals, but still suffers a mechanical control abnormality," China's lunar program spokesman Pei Zhaoyu told Xinhua.

"The rover entered hibernation while in an abnormal state. We were worried it wouldn't be able to make it through the extreme cold of the lunar night. But it came back alive. The rover stands a chance of being saved as it is still alive."

READ MORE: China's moon landing

Xinhua also posted a screenshot of the Chang'e-3 Moon Probe's Sina Weibo account, which, at 8.49am Thursday morning local time, asked: "Is anyone out there?"

The rover has over 300,000 followers on the Chinese Twitter-like social media site, some of whom celebrated the lucky robot's resurrection.

One Weibo user said that the rabbit was "waking up for the [Chinese lantern] festival" which starts on Friday.

Another took a cynical view, commenting that some countries would "be disappointed" at China's space program's ability to come back from the dead.

An amateur website dedicated to monitoring radio signals from space also reported on its Twitter account that it had detected "pretty good signals" from the device.

The lunar rover's end seemed near when it signed off at the end of January with a poignant message: "Goodnight humanity."

READ MORE: China's moon rover launched successfully

The device had been out of action for two weeks following a technical malfunction, and media around the world filed its obituary late on Wednesday after a short statement on Chinese state media alerted the world to its apparent terminal failings.

"China's first lunar rover, Yutu, could not be restored to full function on Monday as expected," the report stated.

However, the robot has given its fans in China and around the world hope that it will resume its planned three-month mission and continue examining the moon's surface for potential resources.

The deputy chief designer of the Chang-e probe system told China National Radio the technical team is still trying to determine the source of problem and work on the plan for repair.

Should Jade Rabbit make a full recovery, it would cap another success for space exploration, which has seen NASA's Opportunity Mars rover, currently exploring the red planet, far outlast its expected lifespan.

Toulouse (CNN) -- French police had no grounds on which to arrest gunman Mohammed Merah before he carried out three attacks in which seven people died, Prime Minister Francois Fillon told French radio station RTL Friday.

Merah, 23, who was shot dead by special forces Thursday after a siege lasting more than 30 hours in the southwestern city of Toulouse, was wanted in the killings of three French paratroopers, a rabbi and three children ages 4, 5, and 7.

Merah, a French citizen of Algerian descent, had been put under surveillance after trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan, officials have said, leading commentators to ask why he was not stopped sooner.

He claimed to have attended an al Qaeda training camp, according to Paris prosecutor Francois Molins, and was on the U.S. no-fly list for that reason, a U.S. intelligence official said.

And Toulouse lawyer Eric Mouton, acting for a woman named only as Aicha, to protect her privacy, told CNN she filed a complaint against Merah in 2010 over alarming behavior Merah displayed toward her children.

Aicha claimed that Merah had beaten up her daughter, 19 at the time, and held her son, 15, against his will in a room for several hours, forcing him to watch videos of violent combat and of people's throats being slit.

Mouton said he would meet with Toulouse prosecutor Michel Valet later Friday to discuss the case. It is not known if any action was taken against Merah at the time.

Fillon defended the police and intelligence services, saying they had done a remarkable job in finding the killer within 10 days of the first attack, on March 11.

Fillon acknowledged that some questions should be asked, particularly with regard to surveillance.

But, he said, "there was no single element" that would have allowed the police to arrest Merah before the killings began.

"We don't have the right in a country like ours to keep under permanent surveillance without a judicial decision someone who has committed no offense," he told RTL. "We live in a country under the rule of law."

Crowds gathered in a square in central Toulouse at noon Friday to remember those killed in the attacks.

Toulouse Mayor Pierre Cohen called the rally in solidarity with the families of the victims and as a demonstration of unity against anti-Semitism and racism, CNN affiliate BMF-TV reported.

CNN iReporter Henry Krisch said the mood at the commemoration was "eerily silent and depressed," as the names of the seven dead were read out and a minute's silence was held.

Meanwhile, investigators carrying shovels, metal detectors and hammers re-entered Merah's apartment Friday, continuing their search of the premises.

A police cordon surrounding the property was removed in the afternoon, exposing the messy aftermath of the gun siege to those at the scene.

The first floor balcony from which Merah jumped, still firing, before being shot in the head, has been boarded up. Bullet holes pock the walls and nearby cars, and broken glass lies scattered around.

Elizabeth Allannic, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor, said the detention of Mohammed Merah's mother, brother and his brother's girlfriend had been extended Friday.

Police tracked Merah down via his mother's computer IP address, which was apparently used to respond to an ad posted by the first victim, officials said. Interior Minister Claude Gueant initially told reporters it was the IP address of Merah's brother that led investigators to him.

Fillon said the French domestic intelligence service, the DCRI, had done its job "perfectly well, it identified Mohammed Merah when he traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan, it questioned him and it monitored him, he was under surveillance, on a list, and it was thanks to that listing that he was identified.

"It watched him for the necessary period, and it led to the conclusion that there was no indication or trace that Mohammed Merah was a dangerous man."

Investigations will determine whether Merah acted alone, the prime minister told RTL. He added: "We must not mix religious fundamentalism with terrorism."

French President Nicolas Sarkozy vowed increased legal measures to punish those who pursue extremist activities online or travel overseas for indoctrination and training.

He spoke Thursday as campaigning resumed for the French presidential election, with the first round of voting due next month.

Rival candidate Francois Hollande, appearing at a rally Thursday night, said questions will have to be asked about the Merah case, French media reported.

Earlier, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told radio network Europe 1 that "light must be shed" on events leading up to the shootings by Merah.

"I understand that one can ask whether there was a failing or not. As I don't know if there was a failing, I can't tell you what kind of failing, but light must be shed on that," Juppe said.

The day after his third and final attack, on a Jewish school, Merah was tracked down to an apartment in Toulouse, where a siege began in the early hours Wednesday.

It finally came to a bloody end Thursday morning, when Merah emerged from a bathroom in his apartment and fired more than 30 shots at police who had burst in to end the standoff, Molins said.

Merah then jumped out a window onto a balcony, still shooting, and was found dead on the ground, officials said.

He died from a gunshot wound to the head, Molins said.

After Merah's death, Sarkozy said everything had been done to bring him to justice alive but security forces could not be exposed to further risk.

Authorities said the young man cited a variety of reasons for the killings, including the missions of French troops abroad, the oppression of Palestinians and France's ban on the wearing of Islamic veils.

After Merah was killed, police found video he had recorded of the attacks, ammunition and ingredients for explosives, Molins said.

In the video of the first shooting of a French soldier in Toulouse, Merah told the soldier, "You kill my brothers, I kill you," Molins told reporters. Another video shows Merah gunning down two more French soldiers in Montauban. He is heard saying "Allahu Akbar," or "God is great," Molins said.

Gueant said Merah had been under surveillance by French intelligence for years.

He had "already committed certain infractions, some with violence," Gueant said.

Merah was sentenced 15 times by a Toulouse juvenile court when he was a minor, Molins said. The charges mostly involved theft.

In the first shooting on March 11, Imad Ibn Ziaten, a paratrooper of North African origin, arranged to meet a man in Toulouse who wanted to buy a scooter Ziaten had advertised online, the interior minister said. The victim said in the ad that he was in the military.

Four days later, two other soldiers were shot dead and another injured by a black-clad man wearing a motorcycle helmet in a shopping center in the city of Montauban, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Toulouse.

In the attack at the private Jewish school Ozar Hatorah on Monday, a man wearing a motorcycle helmet and driving a motor scooter pulled up and shot a teacher and three children -- two of them the teacher's young sons -- in the head. The other victim, the daughter of the school's director, was killed in front of her father.

Police said the same guns were used in all three attacks.

A  compounding pharmacy at the center of a fungal meningitis outbreak last year has agreed to a preliminary settlement that would create a $100 million fund for victims.

The fund will also be used to pay off creditors of the bankrupt New England Compounding Center, attorneys in the case said. A judge will have to approve the plan before it goes into effect.

The nationwide meningitis outbreak was linked to steroid injections distributed by the Massachusetts-based pharmacy. More than 700 illnesses and 64 deaths in 20 states were blamed on the injections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. But the CDC noted the deaths are from "all causes among persons who meet the case definition and

The pharmacy's owners said they deny any liability or wrongdoing, but want to play a major role in establishing a fund for those who died or suffered "as a result of this tragic outbreak," according to a statement announcing the settlement.

Paul Moore, a trustee of the bankrupt pharmacy, supported the preliminary settlement agreement.

"We are pleased that a significant amount of funds will become available for distribution to victims and their families as compensation for the deaths, injuries and suffering they endured as a result of this tragic meningitis outbreak," Moore said.

The settlement amount would be funded by cash from the pharmacy's owners as well as other sources, such as insurance, tax refunds and the sale of a related business.

Ripple effect

In February, Massachusetts health officials ordered 11 compounding pharmacies to completely or partially shut down after unannounced inspections in the wake of the fungal meningitis outbreak.

"Over the course of the unannounced inspections, partial or complete cease and desist orders were issued to 11 pharmacies for a range of violations," the health department said.

Following the outbreak, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick's administration said it launched "a series of aggressive initiatives" aimed at preventing a recurrence.

Those include new regulations requiring sterile compounding pharmacies to report volume and distribution to the state for the first time and the hiring of additional inspectors.
Washington (CNN) -- The federal government filed suit Tuesday against Wyndham Hotels after sensitive customer data, including credit card numbers and personal information, allegedly were stolen three times in less than two years.

In court documents, the Federal Trade Commission alleges Wyndham Hotels' lax security policies allowed Russian hackers to access more than 500,000 customer accounts on three separate occasions between 2008 and 2010. Hackers used the data to rack up more than $10.6 million in fraudulent credit card transactions, according to the suit filed in the U.S. District Court of Arizona.

The security breaches involved Wyndham's Phoenix, Arizona, data center, the main hub where the company stores and transfers data between its corporate headquarters and affiliates.

By gaining access to the Arizona data center, hackers were able to install "phishing" software on numerous Wyndham servers around the world and gain access to customer data, the FTC's lawsuit alleges.

"At the time of these incidents, we made prompt efforts to notify the hotel customers whose information may have been compromised, and offered them credit monitoring services," Michael Valentino, Wyndham's worldwide director of communications, said in a statement to CNN.

But Wyndham failed to take proper security measures even after the company was aware of a security breach, according to the FTC's complaint. The FTC said Wyndham should have instituted complex user IDs and passwords, and fixed software that stored the company's customer credit card data in clear readable text. Wyndham didn't make the fixes, the government alleges, and the hackers were able to gain access to servers on two more occasions.

"Even after faulty security led to one breach ... Wyndham still failed to remedy known security vulnerabilities; failed to employ reasonable measures to detect unauthorized access; failed to follow proper incident response procedures," the FTC said in a statement announcing the suit.

There is no penalty for first-time violators of the FTC's Consumer Privacy Act, and this is the first time Wyndham has been charged with violating the act. But according to Kristen Cohen, an attorney in the FTC's privacy and identity protection division, the agency is seeking a permanent injunction that would force Wyndham to implement what the agency considers reasonable and appropriate security measures for customer information.

Wyndham Hotel Group claims to be the world's largest hotel company with more than 7,000 hotels worldwide. The company operates hotels and resorts under the Wyndham brand, and includes Ramada, Super 8, Days Inn and Howard Johnson and several other hotel companies among its affiliates.
(CNN) -- The United States and Afghanistan have reached a deal on the final language of a bilateral security agreement, guiding the role of American troops in that south Asian nation for years to come, America's top diplomat said Wednesday.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the accord was reached during conversations Wednesday between himself and Afghan President Hamid Karzai.

Afghan leaders will hold a meeting -- known as a loya jirga, or grand assembly -- starting on Thursday to decide whether to accept or reject the deal, which lays out a limited support role for American forces beyond next year.

"They have to pass it," Kerry said. "... It's up to the people of Afghanistan."

If approved, the agreement would go into effect January 1, 2015, and last "until the end of 2024 and beyond, unless terminated" by mutual agreement and with two years notice by either party, according to a copy of the deal posted online Wednesday by the Afghan government that a U.S. official confirms is authentic.

Rice: Reports of a U.S. apology to Afghanistan are false

The subject of military raids and strikes has long been a sore point between the two countries, especially given a number of incidents in which noncombatant men, women and children were killed.

The proposed deal contains references to respecting "Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity," and adds U.S. forces "shall not target Afghan civilians, including in their homes."

But this agreement does not address past transgressions. In fact, Kerry strongly rejected a U.S. apology for operations that resulted in civilian casualties was part of the back-and-forth, as some published reports suggested, insisting "it's just not even on the table."

"I don't know where the idea of an apology started," Kerry said. "President Karzai didn't ask for an apology. ... There has never been a discussion of or the word apology used in our discussions whatsoever."

The agreement does state that U.S. forces will play a support role in Afghanistan, while at the same time ceding that "U.S. military operations to defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates may be appropriate in the common fight against terrorism."

"U.S. military counterterrorism operations are intended to complement and support (the Afghan military's) counterterrorism operations, with the goal of maintaining (the Afghan military's) lead and with full respect for Afghan sovereignty and full regard for the safety and security of the Afghan people, including in their homes," the tentative deal states.

The agreement also includes language on the U.S. government's continued funding for Afghan security forces, funneling such contributions through the Kabul-based government. The U.S. military "shall have the exclusive right" to discipline and prosecute its members for alleged acts committed on Afghan soil, according to the tentative deal, though Afghan authorities can ask that anyone be taken out of the country.

U.S. troops first deployed to Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, which were coordinated by al Qaeda leaders then based in the south Asian nation.

Since taking office, President Barack Obama has promised -- and, in some cases, acted -- to reduce troop levels there, in addition to stating the goal of ending the U.S. combat mission by the end of 2014.

The approval of a security agreement would pave the way for Americans troops to remain on the ground in Afghanistan beyond that.

Speaking on Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney stressed that any U.S. forces would have "a very limited mission" and would not be "patrolling cities or mountains."

"The war in Afghanistan will end next year, as the president has promised," Carney said. "The combat mission will be over."

Kerry used similar language in calling the U.S. military's role in Afghanistan "very limited," adding "it is entirely (to) train, equip and assist" Afghan forces.

The language in the proposed security agreement, in fact, speaks to that point: "Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the United States forces shall not conduct combat operations in Afghanistan."

Pakistani police say they have arrested up to 40 people in connection with the killing of a Christian couple in Punjab province who were beaten, then pushed into a burning kiln after being accused of desecrating the Quran.

Local police officials said a mob from neighboring villages formed Tuesday after a local mullah declared the couple were guilty of blasphemy.

The mob allegedly marched to the couple's home, broke down their door, dragged them outside, beat them and threw them into the brick kiln where they both worked.

The attack happened in the town of Kot Radha Kishan, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of Lahore, the capital of Punjab. Police officials identified the woman as Shyman Bibi Urf Shamar, and her husband as Sajjad Nasir Zurjah Nazir Nasir.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), which dispatched a team to the scene, said in a statement that the couple had three young children -- two sons and a daughter, and indicated the slain woman was pregnant.

"HRCP is shocked and saddened beyond words by the callous murder of the couple and their unborn child," the group said.

According to the statement, the HRCP team "did not come across any evidence of desecration of the Holy Quran."

Desecration of the Quran is punishable by death or life imprisonment under Pakistan's anti-blasphemy law.

Human rights groups have long urged the country to repeal the law, arguing that it has led to discrimination, persecution and murder.

It is often used to settle personal vendettas, rights groups say, and people accused of the committing the crime are frequently targeted by mob violence.

That, according to the HRCP, appeared to be the situation in Kot Radha Kishan, and that the incident stemmed with a dispute over money the kiln's owners said the couple owed them.

An accusation that the couple had desecrated the Quran "was spread to nearby villages and announcements [were] made through mosque loudspeakers," the HRCP said.

The mob that went to the kiln was estimated at around 500 people, the rights group said, citing local police.

The HRCP said its team learned that four policemen went to the kiln to demand that the couple be handed over for protection from the mob, but that the owners "instructed their employees not to hand the couple over and the policemen were also beaten up."

The kiln's owners were among those arrested, the rights group said, quoting police.

(CNN) -- Six Uyghurs who were imprisoned in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were transferred Saturday to the South Pacific island nation of Palau, the Justice Department said.

Ahmad Tourson, Abdul Ghappar Abdul Rahman, Edham Mamet, Anwar Hassan, Dawut Abdurehim and Adel Noori were resettled in Palau, the Justice Department said in a statement Saturday.

Seven Uyghurs are still at Guantanamo Bay, where 215 prisoners remain. Uyghur is an ethnic group from western China.

Since January, 25 detainees have been transferred to other countries.

The United States has coordinated with Palau "to ensure that the transfers take place under appropriate security measures and will continue to consult with the Republic of Palau regarding the individuals," the Justice Department said.

The 13 Uyghurs were accused of receiving weapons and military training in Afghanistan. Some of them have been cleared for release since 2003, and other Uyghurs have been released to other countries. The United States said it would not send them back to their homeland because of concern they would be tortured by Chinese authorities.

The Chinese government has said no returned Uyghurs would be mistreated and has repeatedly warned other countries against taking the men. Beijing officials this summer again urged the United States to hand over all remaining Uyghurs instead of sending them elsewhere.

China alleges the men are part of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a group the U.S. State Department considers a terrorist organization, that operates in the Xinjiang region. East Turkestan is another name for Xinjiang.

On October 20, the Supreme Court tentatively agreed to accept an appeal from the 13 Uyghurs to be released into the United States from American military custody.

Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan took a pragmatic approach to the issue of late-term abortion when working as a top lawyer in the Clinton White House, documents released Friday show.

The material was part of more than 46,000 pages released by the William J. Clinton Presidential Library. Kagan was a top lawyer in the administration's Office of Domestic Policy.

At issue at the time was a bill in the Republican-controlled Congress that would ban a type of abortion performed in the second trimester. Critics of the procedure called it "partial-birth" abortion.

In a February 27, 1997 memo to top White House staff, Kagan notes a leading abortion rights supporter had just admitted late-term abortions were being "performed more frequently than pro-choice groups have acknowledged, and often perfonned [sic - performed] on healthy women with healthy fetuses," repeating a claim conservatives at the time had long made.

Kagan advises "it would be a great mistake to challenge" the statements of Ron Fitzsimmons, then executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers.

Nonetheless, Kagan said the controversy did not undermine the president's stated position that he would support the GOP bill with some exceptions.

"The president's position today remains what it has always been," wrote Kagan, "that he will sign a bill banning partial-birth abortions, but only if it has an exception that will protect those women -- even if few in number -- who need this procedure to save their lives or prevent serious harm to their health."

The Supreme Court three years ago affirmed a similar federal ban on the procedure, passed by Congress in 2003. That bill did not include a "health exception."

Kagan in her memos at the time repeatedly used the term "partial-birth" favored by anti-abortion groups and one which abortion-rights activists had tried to replace, believing it was inaccurate and inflammatory.

The documents reveal another person heavily involved in the abortion issue: Rahm Emanuel, then a senior adviser in the Clinton White House. He is now President Obama's chief of staff.

Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee have sought a delay in Kagan's confirmation hearings, scheduled for the week of June 28, saying this latest batch of documents gives them little time to learn about her views on hot-button social and legal issues.

Some 160,000 pages of documents are being reviewed from Kagan's four-years in the Clinton White House from 1995-1999, during which she also served as deputy associate counsel. Papers from her time in that position will be released in coming days.

Kagan also was heavily involved in negotiations to clamp down on the tobacco industry. The White House and Congress had sought a compromise to enact tough marketing restrictions, especially those aimed at young people.

Kagan appeared to view her role in the Domestic policy office as both a lawyer and political adviser, worrying that both  Democrats and Republicans could back away from the legislation.

In an April 1998 memo, she and her boss Bruce Reed told the president that "we should not ask for more than we need to achieve our public health goals and in the process destroy any chance of industry acquiescence ... efforts to push the price too far would be counterproductive because tobacco-state Democrats will join with Republicans to derail a bill that goes as far as some in the public health community might like."

Both Reed and Kagan indirectly acknowledged such a middle-of-the road compromise approach would anger many members of the administration and liberal health reform advocates.

Kagan, then 37, also noted proposals from within the administration might go too far and later be declared unconstitutional by the federal courts.

"I'm not sure I buy the argument" made by other White House officials that First Amendment free speech concerns would not become a barrier to passage of the bill, she noted in her own handwriting on one memo. It was part of a draft letter to a Republican senator and dealt with her view the tobacco industry should unilaterally promote voluntary advertising limits. "We should enable the companies to agree on this," wrote Kagan.

Kagan was nominated in May by President Barack Obama to succeed the retiring Justice John Paul Stevens. Until she she stepped down last month, Kagan was the administration's solicitor general, which argues federal government cases before the Supreme Court. She has no judicial experience, and conservative critics have been eagerly scanning her past record in government service and academia for clues on what kind of justice she may turn out be, if confirmed by the Senate.

"As we suspected, President Obama nominated a far left liberal who supports both abortion and 'gay marriage,'" said Penny Nance, CEO of Concerned Women for America. "Elena Kagan has also demonstrated her disdain for the unborn, the most vulnerable in our society."

On affirmative action, Kagan weighed in on a pending Supreme Court challenge by a white teacher in New Jersey who had been fired in favor of a black teacher, when both had equal seniority. The Bush administration in 1992 had filed suit in support of the white teacher, saying she had been a victim of discrimination on account of race, in violation of federal law.

At the time, the Clinton administration had to decide whether to continue the legal challenge in federal courts. Then-Solicitor General Walter Dellinger noted the language of his legal brief to the justices "is a sensitive one."

The administration decided to support the white teacher on narrow grounds, that in this case the school board failed to offer an adequate justification for the public employee's dismissal. Kagan supported that view, but she and others in the Clinton White House also wanted to clarify that race-based decisions were sometimes justified in the name of diversity -- "to mend (without ending) affirmative action."

"I think this is exactly the right position," wrote Kagan in the margins of the Solicitor General's memo, "as a legal matter, as a policy matter, and as a political matter."

She signed it "Elena."
Former President George W. Bush has a number of accomplishments under his belt: Texas governor, U.S. president, and now, a New York Times best-selling author.

But even though Bush's book about his father -- "41: A Portrait of My Father" -- has been No. 1 on the Times' nonfiction sellers list for weeks, Bush admits the book isn't exactly a historical biography.

"It's a love story," Bush told Candy Crowley on CNN's "State of the Union."

"I'm not the least bit ashamed to say it's not very objective," he added. "I also happen to think it's a handbook on fatherhood. If somebody's interested in how a person was a great father, even though he's very busy, this book is such an example."

Bush 'wanted Dad to be alive' to read biography

In the interview, Bush jokes that neither he nor The New York Times had any idea that his book would become a best-seller.

But the former president didn't write the book with sales in mind. Instead, he says, he felt the need to publish his father's story, to reintroduce his dad to America in a way that no one has ever known him.

"He's an extraordinary person, not only because of his accomplishments but because of his character," Bush said. "I understand how history works; It takes a long time for people to get to know him, get to know somebody and then analyze their decisions. But I wanted to be one of the first people out in the evaluation of George H.W. Bush."

Bush also tried to dispel any rumors of competition between him and his father.

41 things about Bush 41

"Stiff competition is overstated," Bush said. "In other words, if you love somebody as much as I love my dad, and my brothers loved my dad, my sister, there's no need to compete."

The fact that the elder Bush is still alive to see the book also meant a lot to him, Bush said.

"I'm glad Dad's alive when it comes out," he said. "Secondly, I'm glad that a lot of his friends are alive and can take it in and say, 'wow, this is the guy I know.'"

Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- In 1998, Kevin Warwick became what some people call "the world's first cyborg." To be exact, Warwick, a professor of cybernetics at Reading University, had a radio frequency ID chip implanted in his arm. Years before RFID chips became common, this small implant allowed him to turn on lights by snapping his fingers, or open doors without touching them.

Once, after connecting his nerves to an array of electrodes in 2002, he let his wife use her brain waves to take control of his body. It was the first time the nervous systems of two humans had communicated electronically. "It was quite an intimate feeling," he says.

This isn't just for fun, Warwick tells Motherboard.tv, VBS' technology channel. He is certain that without upgrading, we humans will someday fall behind the advances of the robots we're building -- or worse. "Someday we'll switch on that machine, and we won't be able to switch it off," he says, sounding a note of alarm that clashes with the cheery visions of futurists like Ray Kurzweil. That might explain why he has very little technology at home, and counts "The Terminator" among his biggest influences.

Warwick doesn't want to turn into a robot: He wants to be a better human. Augmenting human ability, not turning into an automaton, is, after all, the premise of the "cyborg." One of the term's earliest uses, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was in a 1960 New York Times article: "A cyborg is essentially a man-machine system in which the control mechanisms of the human portion are modified externally by drugs or regulatory devices so that the being can live in an environment different from the normal one."

See the rest of "The Cyborg" at VBS.TV

Today, the argument for cybernetics may seem more imperative than ever. Already the latest bionic technologies are allowing deaf children to hear and disabled war veterans to run again. Technologists, meanwhile, see "augmented reality" applications for smartphones as doing something similar for our brains, fortifying them for life in a world overflowing with data.

For now, Warwick, who will be awarded the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine in 2011, is using his research into brain interfaces and autonomous robots to provide better insight into how memories are formed, and learn how to better treat brain diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. "Technology, directly integrated with the brain, can help overcome some problems people have," says Warwick. Brain implants could keep people fit, making sure, for instance, "you don't eat that chocolate cake that you want."

But the possibilities may also be stranger than we have yet imagined. Someday, says Warwick, humans could become "a curiosity for the machines."

" 'Look at that -- that's where we were in historical times,' they will think to each other."
(Entertainment Weekly) -- After all the anticipation and hubbub, the weekend is coming to an end and the box office results are here: "Watchmen" (No. 1) grossed $55.7 million during its first frame, according to early estimates from Media by Numbers.

"Watchmen" led the weekend box office, grossing $55.7 million during its first weekend.

That's a solid sum, to be sure, although it's certainly on the low end of most projections. "Watchmen" premiered in more theaters (3,611) than any other R-rated movie in history, and it averaged an impressive $15,413 per venue, despite a potentially problematic long running time.

It also scored the biggest debut of 2009 so far. Nonetheless, the movie's $55.7 million take (including $5.5 million from 124 IMAX screens) is substantially smaller than the $70.9 million that 300, the last R-rated graphic-novel movie from director Zack Snyder, earned on its opening weekend two years ago.

And aside from that theater-count statistic (which almost any film could break at any time, really), there will be no major records to report on this weekend (for example, "Watchmen's" debut was just the fifth-best opening ever for an R-rated movie).

I'd argue, in fact, that this opening is a bit soft, considering the great expectations that came with Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore's landmark comic book -- not to mention "Watchmen's" hefty grosses from screenings at midnight on Friday and throughout its first day. After attracting some major initial interest, banking $25.1 million on Friday, the film's audience dropped off dramatically during the weekend: It grossed $19 million on Saturday and is expected to bring in just $11.5 million on Sunday.

These are all big numbers, don't get me wrong, but, when combined with the fact that the film got a lukewarm CinemaScore grade of B from an audience that was largely comprised of older men, it all points to a rapid downward trend that may be difficult to reverse in the weeks to come.

Elsewhere -- yes, there were other movies playing at the multiplex this weekend! -- a number of films continued to do what "Watchmen" must now aspire to, perhaps in vain: They stayed strong deep into their long runs.

Tyler Perry's "Madea Goes to Jail" (No. 2) grossed $8.8 million on its third weekend; the film, Perry's biggest yet at the box office, has banked $76.5 million to date.

"Taken" (No. 3) also moved along like the unstoppable force it has been for more than a month now, earning $7.5 million and bringing its six-week sum to $118 million.

Best Picture winner "Slumdog Millionaire" (No. 4) was next with $6.9 million, which boosted its domestic haul to $125.4 million. And "Paul Blart: Mall Cop" (No. 5) took its eight-week total to $133.6 million thanks to another $4.2 million gross. iReport.com: What did you think of 'Watchmen'?

Meanwhile, "Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience" (No. 9) completely fell off the map, dropping a staggering 78 percent to gross just $2.8 million. According to Box Office Mojo, that's the 15th biggest second-weekend decline of all time.

Overall, the cumulative box office was up nearly 8 percent over the same frame a year ago, when 10,000 B.C. opened big, making this the fifth consecutive "up" weekend at the multiplex. So, all in all, I'd say today's was a good report, indeed.

Oxford, England (CNN) -- The first coffeehouse to open in England, a still-operating café on High Street in Oxford, is more than a place to get a beef and horseradish sandwich, according to author and blogger Steven Berlin Johnson. It represents a turning point in Western culture that helped usher in nearly 500 years of scientific and cultural progress.

The reason: Until coffee and tea became popular, "alcohol was the daytime drink of choice," he told the TED Global conference in Oxford on Tuesday. Water wasn't safe to drink, so wine, beer or gin was a better choice for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

"Until the rise of the coffeehouse, the entire population was effectively drunk all day," Johnson said in a talk aimed at explaining how ideas get started. "If you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life, you would have better ideas."

Moreover, the setting of a coffeehouse, which encourages the mixing of people from different backgrounds, is perfect for sharing and crafting innovative thoughts.

"An astonishing number of innovations have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story," he said.

Great ideas often don't result from a single "eureka" moment, but instead come from what Johnson called "the slow hunch," as they evolve and interact with other ideas.

He traced the development of GPS technology, starting in the 1950s with efforts by Western scientists to track the Russian Sputnik spacecraft. And that same GPS technology now can help you find a nearby coffeehouse that will serve you a soy latte, Johnson joked.

Mixing and sharing ideas was one of the themes of the opening speakers at TED Global, where the theme is "And Now the Good News."

Matt Ridley, author of "The Rational Optimist," says the sharing of ideas -- or in his phrase, "ideas having sex with each other" -- is a tremendously powerful force driving human progress.

Watch Matt Ridley's talk at TED.com

Exchanging ideas allows tremendous specialization of labor, to the point where no single person can fully understand what it takes to create an object as complex as a computer mouse, which relies on the efforts of millions in industries as diverse as the oil industry that creates the plastics to the coffeehouse that supplies a drink to the product's designer.

"We've created something called the collective brain," Ridley said. "We're just the nodes, the neurons in the brain ... "

"As we go forward, we will of course experience terrible things. There will be wars, there will be natural disasters ... but because of the connections people are making and the ability of ideas to meet and mate as never before, I'm also sure that living standards will advance ... we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation."

A tripling of the productivity of agricultural land in past decades has saved some of the tropical rainforest and Ridley predicted that rainforests could start increasing in the second half of the century as the human population peaks and starts to decline.

Other ideas were mixing and mating in Oxford at the first day of TED Global, which is a product of the nonprofit TED, dedicated to "ideas worth spreading."

Among the ideas were these:

China's rise not a cause for fear

Joseph Nye of Harvard University, the influential thinker and former assistant defense secretary, cautioned against equating the rise of China and Asia with the decline of America and the West.

He pointed to recurrent and groundless fears of U.S. decline over the past 50 years and noted that in the larger story of history, Asia is regaining influence that it had 200 years ago, before the Industrial Revolution.

China's gain doesn't have to be the West's loss: "If China develops greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with carbon emissions, that's good for us," Nye said.

Cause of the 21st century: Ending oppression of women

Sheryl WuDunn, the author of "Half the Sky" with her husband, Nicholas Kristof, said the 19th century's central moral challenge was ending slavery, the 20th century's was ending totalitarianism and this century must be about freeing and empowering women.

"More girls have been discriminated to death" in past decades, she said, than people killed on the battlefields of the 20th century.

Educating girls and bringing them into the work force limits population growth, since educated women tend to have significantly fewer children.

She told the story of an aid worker who saw horrible things happen in Darfur without breaking down. In the backyard of the woman's grandmother, back in the U.S., she saw a bird feeder and broke down in tears.

"We have the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted," she said, and we can feed and house ourselves and even put out food so wild birds won't starve in the winter. Americans and those in other Western countries "have all won the lottery of life," and have an obligation to help people throughout the world.

Strength of a nation isn't how much it can produce

Nic Marks, founder of the Center for Well-being at the New Economics Foundation in London, said all the daily measures people hear in the news relating to stock prices, exchange rates and gross domestic product emphasize greed without tapping into human happiness.

"Our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce," Marks said, quoting Robert Kennedy's famous statement that "the gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile."

"How crazy is that?" Marks said. Surveys show people want happiness, love and health more than they want wealth.

"These are natural human aspirations, why are statisticians not measuring that, instead of being fixated on how much stuff we have?"

The liberating power of cartoons

Patrick Chappatte, an editorial cartoonist based in Switzerland, picked up on the theme of questionable consumerism by showing a cartoon of Steve Jobs making a pitch for the iPhone: "It'll simplify a lot of tasks you never had to do before."

A man sees a newspaper vendor's poster: "Print media is dying," and says "I already read that on the internet yesterday."

The punchline of another cartoon: "The internet has changed music. Before we had to go to the store to steal it.

And yet another, showing a confessional as someone behind a curtain says "Father, I've sinned," and the priest, Googling the parishioner on a computer screen says, "I know."

Cartoons are in the middle of a clash of civilizations, Chappatte said, as free expression collides with those who want to enforce religious orthodoxy around the world.

For dictators around the world, he said, "good news is when cartoonists, activists and journalists shut up."

And when their ideas stop having sex.
(CNN) -- France is en vogue at the moment.

Its parliament has backed gay marriage, "Les Miserables" has taken the movie world by storm, McDonald's is launching the "McCamembert" Burger and David Beckham has jetted in to join the French Revolution at Paris Saint-Germain.

Vive le France? Not so for those earning more than $1.3 million a year, especially after Socialist President Francois Hollande announced he would introduce a top income tax rate of 75%.

It has become a real point of contention, with some -- including top sports stars -- threatening to move abroad.

Depardieu ditches France for Putin's Russia

Renowned actor Gerard Depardieu has already taken up the offer of Russian citizenship, despite France's constitutional court vetoing Hollande's proposal.

But while the plans over taxation are on hold, those involved with the nation's football are worried that their star assets are heading to the United Kingdom and abroad to seek sanctuary.

"What you see is that French football loses good players, all leaving for England, so the Premier League will be above all the other leagues," Marseille manager Elie Baup told reporters.

"In France, because of the financial side, we will have to work on young players or with recruits not well known, and then we'll make them big, and they'll go to England again. We are entering this 'cycle.' "

During the January transfer window, international striker Loic Remy left French title contender Marseille to move to Queens Park Rangers, a club which was bottom of the English Premier League and threatened with relegation.

Football's middle men eye rich pickings in transfer window

Even more remarkably in January, no less than five Frenchman made the switch to Newcastle, a move which led to the hanging of the "Tricolor" in the EPL club's canteen.

Lille's Mathieu Debuchy, Montpellier's Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, Massadio Haidara from Nancy, Toulouse's Moussa Sissoko and Bordeaux's Yoann Gouffran all made the move to the north east of England.

They should feel at home as there's already more than a hint of Gallic flair at St. James' Park, with the wonderfully talented pair of Yohan Cabaye and Hatem Ben Arfa at the club, as well as the likes of Sylvain Marveaux, Gabriel Obertan and Romain Amalfitano.

"I'm not surprised that they want to play there because it's the best league, but I am surprised by just how many French players have gone there at the same time," former Newcastle and France player Didier Domi told CNN.

However, Domi insisted that financial motivation was not the reason for this footballing exodus to Newcastle.

"Tax is not a big factor. The biggest draw is the chance to play in front of packed stadia every week," he said.

"It's the place where all players want to play. When the French players come back to France after a spell in England, they all talk about how great it is.

"It's professional, it has great fans and atmosphere and it's where all the best players are. I loved it at Newcastle. The fans and people of the north east are so friendly and full of warmth."

Mickelson has a point on taxes

In the last French election, held in May 2012 -- the French population in London was given the opportunity to vote on the establishment of a parliamentary member for Northern Europe.

There are 120,000 officially registered as living in the British capital, but one of those -- politician Axelle Lemaire -- believes the total is nearer 400,000.

Before winning that parliamentary ballot, as a representative of Hollande's Socialist Party, Lemaire lived and worked in London for 12 years.

"Many people come and go between the two countries thanks to the new transport links and there are a lot of younger people who come to London and move on afterwards," she told CNN.

"I arrived in London 12 years ago and I remember reading the headlines in the newspapers then about how French people were moving for tax reasons.

"But the reality is very different. Even now there is a lot being written about people leaving because of the 75% tax reasons. I've not seen any serious figures supporting this. The reality is very different.

"People come here for a whole variety of reasons: to study, to work, to learn English, for love, for the international dimension of the UK.

"Taxes, at the end, are pretty similar in the two countries, and constitute very rarely a reason to move out.

"It has become more and more normal to spend some time in your career or to study abroad.

"Some stay and some leave after a while. Sometimes, bi-national couples move to France if they have a second child because the cost of living is expensive here."

Why Depardieu's 'pathetic' desertion has caused French storm

Lemaire also doubts that recent raft of French arrivals at Newcastle has anything to do with the levels of tax in their own country.

"I think it's a misconception to say they're here because of taxes," she said.

"These players are young and earning their first big contract in a very good club and that's a great opportunity for them.

"'I don't think they've thought to themselves, 'I want to leave for tax reasons.' "

Dubbed "Neufchateau" by the French media, Newcastle is in many ways no different from many other Premier League clubs in luring talent from across the Channel.

The likes of Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Nicolas Anelka, Emmanuel Petit, Marcel Desailly and Claude Makelele are just some of those to enjoy huge success in England.

While the typical English football fan might refer to the French as "Frogs" and take pleasure in mentioning the military victories at Waterloo and Agincourt, the acceptance of French talent on the football field has never been in doubt.

One Frenchman who made the move to England and then to Newcastle was football writer Kevin Quignane, who believes the most difficult task facing his fellow countrymen is understanding the locals' notorious "Geordie" accent.

"There was indeed a bit of a linguistic shock," Quignane recalled following his arrival in the city.

"I'd say that a true, thick Geordie accent is more difficult to understand than a broad Yorkshire brogue, which in itself can be pretty challenging.

"I just couldn't understand our next door neighbor and my partner, who is herself a Geordie, also had great trouble.

"It really can be challenging but by and large, most locals speak with a mild Geordie accent, thank God. That or I've got so used to it that I don't notice anymore."

While it might take time for the newcomers to adapt to the local lingo and swap their Chardonnay for a pint of Newcastle Brown Ale, Quignane believes the recent arrivals will enjoy life in the city.

"Newcastle's stock as a city has risen tremendously in the last decade," he added.

"It's now seen as a vibrant, party-going and sexy place, but it was a very different story 10 years earlier with the demise of the mines and shipyards and the Meadow Well riots in 1991.

"The Quayside, now Newcastle's nightlife epicenter -- revamped and regenerated -- was a mess back then."

Beckham to donate PSG wages to children's charity

Back in France the arrival of a world superstar in Beckham at Paris Saint-Germain has helped softened the blow of so many departing French players.

The midfielder signed a five-month deal with PSG last month and has pledged to donate his salary to a children's charity within the city.

And while worries persist over the numbers of young French players moving aboard, Beckham arrives at a time where big-name foreign players are playing a starring role in Ligue 1.

Backed by its Qatari-based owners, PSG recently paid out $52.8 million for young Brazilian Lucas Moura after securing a $72 million deal for Zlatan Ibrahimovic and defender Thiago Silva from Milan last July.

The club has qualified for the quarterfinals of the Champions League and leads the domestic title race.

"I am very glad," Lemaire said of Beckham's arrival in the French capital.

"I think that it's great that he decided to move to Paris and to donate his wages to charity. It's a very good example.

"It also shows that Paris is a good club and an attractive city."
(CNN) -- A week after students seized Taiwan's legislative building over a controversial trade deal with China, Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou agreed to meet with protest leaders to help end the standoff and allow the legislature to get back on track, a spokesperson for the president's office said.

Ma is willing to invite representatives of the movement to his office "without any preconditions," Li Jia-fei, a spokesperson for the president's office said Tuesday in a statement.

Hundreds of protesters, many of them university students, have been camped out in the Legislative Yuan's main assembly hall since March 18, over a service trade pact that they say could harm Taiwan's economy and allow China to exert greater influence over the island. Thousands more have gathered outside the building, according to organizers.

At a press conference on Tuesday night, student leader Lin Fei-fan responded to the president's invitation, saying the protesters agreed that no preconditions should be set for the meeting.

But, he added, the students wanted to discuss whether Taiwan needed new legislation to monitor all cross-strait agreements, and whether the service trade pact with China should be delayed until that legislation is introduced.

On Wednesday, Lin said the students were rejecting the president's invitation for now as it failed to include a fixed date or time for the talks, or concrete content for discussion. He told CNN that the protesters inside the Legislative Yuan had no plans to leave.

"We are willing to talk, but we really hope to see the president express sincerity," Lin said in a statement on his Facebook page.

The president's office confirmed to CNN that the students had not yet accepted the invitation.

Taiwan signed the service trade pact with China, its biggest trade partner in June last year, but it is yet to be ratified. The agreement will open up 80 of China's service sectors to Taiwan and 64 of Taiwan's service sectors to China, including tourism, transport, construction and telecommunications.

A review of the deal was delayed in Taiwan's legislature until March 17, when Taiwan's ruling party Kuomintang pushed the pact forward without bipartisan deliberation. The main opposition said that this move broke an agreement that all legislators would consider the deal one clause at a time.

Protesters, who claimed negotiations over the deal were opaque and undemocratic, broke into the legislative building in Taipei the next day, demanding that the pact be scrapped.

The demonstration has been mostly peaceful, but tensions boiled over late Sunday, when a group of protesters stormed the nearby executive building. More than 100 people were injured when riot police armed with wooden batons and shields evicted the protesters and dispersed the crowd using water cannon.

Hours before the scuffle, Taiwan's president defended the deal in his first public address to the protests. Calling on the protesters to adhere to the rule of law, Ma said the pact would create jobs for young people and that without regional economic integration, Taiwan would be left behind.

Student leader Lin Fei-fan,speaking to CNN by phone from inside the legislature building Monday, criticized the pact. He claimed the deal would allow China to invest in "sensitive and core industries" including those associated with press freedom, such as publishing and advertising.

Taiwan split from mainland China in 1949 following the Chinese Civil War, but Beijing still considers it a breakaway province, and has warned that any formal declaration of independence could lead to military intervention.

However, cross-strait ties have improved since Ma took office in 2008, and recent high-level talks between the two sides have been hailed as a sign of thawing relations.

On Monday, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, Marie Harf told reporters that the United States has welcomed steps by Taiwan and China to reduce tensions and improve relations, and hopes that talks over the trade deal can be conducted "peacefully and civilly."

"We certainly support Taiwan's vibrant democracy, which allows for this kind of robust political dialogue," Harf said.

The protests have garnered widespread support among Taiwanese living abroad. Rallies are being held in at least 10 countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States.

(CNN) -- Passions run high at the coalface of an Ashes series and the heat clearly affects those at the pinnacle of Australian politics too.

As his nation battles to win the third Test against England, and keep the five-match series alive, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has left the game's officials in no doubt as to his disgust.

With the match only a few hours old, Aussie batsman Usman Khawaja was given out caught behind by umpire Tony Hill, a call he instantly reviewed.

And though countless replays offered no evidence Khawaja had hit the ball, the video umpire upheld the on-field decision, condemning the 26-year-old to a long trudge back to the pavilion.

Rudd, who ousted Julia Gillard in a leadership election to become Prime Minister for a second time in June, was so incensed he took to Twitter to voice his displeasure to over 1.3 million followers.

Using modern technology to bemoan cricket's new-age technology he wrote: "I've just sat down to watch the test. That was one of the worst cricket umpiring decisions I have ever seen."

At the close of play on the first day, captain Michael Clarke's unbeaten century leading his side to a commanding position at 303-3, Rudd's message had been retweeted 2,759 times.

His viewpoint was supported by one of Australia's greatest ever cricketers, Shane Warne, who took 708 Test wickets with his leg spin bowling during a glittering career.

In his role as a television commentator he labeled the decision "ridiculous" and was one of the thousands that retweeted Rudd's remarks.

"There was daylight between bat and ball, there was no hot spot and no noise," Warne said. "The only noise was when the bat hit his pad.

"You can see the bat hitting the pad, the ball goes past, no noise. There was clear evidence there as well. That is a ridiculous decision."

Umpiring decisions have caused much controversy in the previous two Tests matches, both won by England, who is looking to retain the Ashes for the third straight series.

Under the Decision Review System (DRS) both sides get two reviews per innings, meaning they can refer a decision to a video umpire if they think it is wrong.

The numerous camera angles available, as well as sound and hotspot technology -- which can detect even the faintest touch of ball on bat -- are designed to eliminate bad calls.

The game's governing body -- the International Cricket Council (ICC) -- was forced to defend the umpiring during the first Test at Trent Bridge in Nottingham after a clutch of poor decisions, from the on-field umpires and their video counterpart.

Rudd is the latest in a long line of Aussie Prime Ministers who have indulged their love of cricket.

John Howard, who served between 1996 and 2007, was a regular visitor to Test matches involving his country at home and abroad. He also launched a bid to become a vice-president of the ICC but was blocked by the organization's board.

Gillard was pictured at various cricketing events, while former premiers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating also tried to tap into their country's love of the game.
Babylon, Iraq (CNN)ISIS has smashed priceless ancient statues in Mosul, bulldozed the ruins of Nineveh and Hatra, and dynamited centuries-old churches, mosques and shrines.

In a battle between Iraqi forces and ISIS over control of Tikrit recently, the tomb of Saddam Hussein was squashed to rubble, though it's not clear which side did it.

Luckily, the ancient city of Babylon is outside the extremists' grasp, south of Baghdad. For nearly 5,000 years it has stood as a symbol of the glory of ancient Mesopotamian civilization.

Saddam Hussein renovated the ruins in the 1980s, leaving his own crude personal stamp on the bricks there. They bear his name and describe him as the son of Nebuchadnezzar, who had the reputation of being ancient Babylon's greatest king.

One of Hussein's former palaces still peers down over the city.

But it continues to be source of great pride for Iraqis who see themselves as the heirs of the world's oldest civilization.

And many Iraqis know better than to buy the claims of their deposed despot. "This wasn't Saddam's," said Adnan Abu Fatima. "It belonged to our grandfathers, the Babylonians."

Abu Fatima strolled through the ruins with his family. Saddam's vain brick inscriptions may annoy him, but ISIS' destruction appalls him.

"The Mosul museum was destroyed. Why?" he wants to know from ISIS. "That is the heritage of your grandfathers. Why did you do that?"

The defacers' reasoning? The artifacts, some of the oldest in ancient civilization, are from the "age of ignorance," ISIS says, before the advent of Islam.

Antiquity is an integral part of Iraq's national identity. History is measured there not in centuries but in millennia, and Iraqi's take such vandalism to heart.

They've had to watch since the U.S. invasion in 2003 how artifacts have been stolen. Baghdad's museum was plundered, during a lapse in U.S. security, and the priceless artifacts were smuggled around the world.

The U.S. State Department has announced it will return more than 60 items on Monday, which had been sneaked into the United States.

Safa ad-Din Hassan and other parents took Iraqi scouts on a camping trip near Babylon to teach them about their history and make ancient artwork with them.

Hassan fled Mosul when ISIS overran it last year then later ransacked the museum. "When I saw what happened, I was determined to come her to preserve our antiquities from ISIS," he said.

Iraq will defend its heritage against ISIS, said Mohamed Hattab from Iraq's Antiquities Department. "Babylon is our soul."

It's a soul under assault by latter day barbarians, who have destroyed much of it in the North, which has been out of the defensive reach of Iraqi soldiers.

The military has started a drive to retake Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from the extremists. After the rage of a battle subsided, they moved in to the outskirt town of Awja to find the former dictator's tomb flattened.

Video of soldiers standing on top of it was posted to YouTube. They celebrated the posthumous slap against their former tormentor. One man fired shots into the rubble toward Hussein's grave site.

It was a piece of history they were glad to part with.

CNN's Ben Wedeman reported and wrote from Babylon, and Ben Brumfield reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.
A Lowndes County, Georgia, assistant district attorney has ordered a communications company to hand over Internet records after investigators received an anonymous e-mail claiming an ex-schoolmate reportedly confessed to killing Kendrick Johnson.

CNN obtained the e-mail and the subpoena on Monday, in response to a state Open Records Act request submitted to the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office.

The anonymous e-mail tip is dated January 27.  The sender of the e-mail does not suggest he or she personally witnessed a confession; instead, the sender claims to have been told information by somebody who purportedly was aware of a confession in the 2013 death by one of the people implicated in the e-mail.

Johnson's body was found in a rolled-up mat in the Lowndes High School gymnasium on January 11, 2013. Investigators with the sheriff's office ruled his death accidental, concluding that Johnson climbed into the center of the gym mat to reach for a shoe and got stuck.

Feds subpoena schoolmates amid probe into teen's death

According to an incident report provided to CNN by the sheriff's office, investigators interviewed two of four students identified by name in the anonymous e-mail on January 28.

Both students acknowledged they knew the 17-year-old Johnson but denied any involvement in his death.

The incident report does not indicate whether the investigators attempted to speak with the two other students identified in the e-mail.

CNN is not naming the students mentioned in the e-mail because none of them has been named a suspect in the death of Johnson.

Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson got stuck while reaching for a shoe at the center of the mat and that his death was accidental.  The state's medical examiner agreed, citing "positional asphyxia" as the cause of death.

Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson believe their son was beaten to death and officials are "covering up a murder."  An independent pathologist, hired by Johnson's parents, concluded Johnson's death was the result of a homicide after finding evidence of "unexplained apparent non-accidental blunt force trauma" to Johnson's neck.

"If anybody has any information of a different opinion that they can provide to us, we're certainly open to looking at that.  We're not closed-minded on this," Lt. Stryde Jones, supervisor of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office's Investigative Division told CNN in May.

The sheriff's office has received many public comments regarding Johnson's death since it closed its case on May 2.  The grand jury subpoena is the first document provided to CNN that suggests the department has acted on any of those public comments.

"Although our case has been closed, if evidence comes forward, specifically testimony, then we're open to hearing that and certainly we'll act accordingly," Lt. Jones said.

Chief Assistant District Attorney Bradfield Shealy issued the subpoena to Mediacom Communications Corporation on January 28.  The New York-based cable, phone and Internet provider was ordered to provide the Lowndes County grand jury with subscriber information associated with the e-mail sent through the Lowndes County sheriff's office's website or submit the documents to the district attorney's office or Lt. Jones before February 26.

According to a Lowndes County Sheriff's Office incident report, the subpoena was faxed to Mediacom on February 7. The company intends to comply with the order.  However, a Mediacom employee told CNN by phone Wednesday that Mediacom has not received the subpoena.

Last week, students from Lowndes High School and nearby Valdosta High School were among those who appeared before a federal grand jury in Macon, as part of the Department of Justice's investigation into Johnson's death.  The U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael Moore, launched the federal probe October 31.
(CNN) -- Just six weeks after the Australian Senate rejected a bill that included opening offshore processing centers for asylum seekers, a government-appointed panel has recommended just that.

The three-member panel, headed by former defense chief Marshal Houston, made 22 recommendations Monday on how the country should deal with thousands of asylum seekers who attempt to reach its shores each year.

The report's release came after a particularly busy weekend for maritime authorities, who intercepted six separate boats carrying a total of 265 people in the three days to Sunday.

It also came as officials investigated claims a boat carrying more than 60 asylum seekers had disappeared en route from Indonesia to Christmas Island, a popular entry point to Australia's asylum system.

Among the Houston report's recommendations was that offshore processing centers be established on the islands of Nauru and Papua New Guinea "as soon as practical."

It also recommended an immediate increase in the number of people accepted each year for asylum from 13,750 to 20,000.

In an effort to reduce the demand for family reunions, it recommended barring people who arrive by boat from being able to sponsor their families to join them.

And rather than dumping the government's controversial and illegal "Malaysia Solution," the report recommended building on the deal "through high-level bilateral engagement focused on strengthening safeguards and accountability."

Under the so-called "Malaysia Solution," Australia would have sent 800 asylum seekers to Malaysia for processing each year in exchange for 4,000 confirmed refugees.

However, the High Court ruled the deal invalid last August on the grounds that, as a non-signatory to the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention, Malaysia has no legal obligation to protect asylum seekers, something required under Australia's Migration Act.

Hours after the report was released, Gillard gave her in-principle backing to all its recommendations and said that Parliament would meet Tuesday to amend the earlier rejected bill to include the provision for processing centers on Nauru and PNG. "We will also move to immediately implement the recommendations on family reunion," she added.

Refugee advocates reacted with outrage to the report, calling it a "rebadging of the Pacific Solution," a reference to the former Liberal government's controversial policy of the last decade.

"At the heart of the panel's report is the policy of deterrence, but all deterrence does is divert people from our doorstep to dangers elsewhere. It doesn't address the circumstances, it just shifts the problem somewhere else," said David Manne, executive director of Australia's Refugee and Immigration Legal Center.

"What we need to do is promote proper protection standards in the region. There needs to be the understanding that it will take time, perseverance and patience. It will be incremental. There are no simple solutions," he added.

The so-called Pacific Solution was introduced by former Prime Minister John Howard in 2001 and involved sending asylum seekers to detention centers on Pacific Island nations while their claims were processed.

The current Labor government abandoned the policy when it took power in 2007. Since then, there has been a sharp increase in asylum seekers making the dangerous trip by boat to seek a new life in Australia.

Between late 2001 and June this year, 964 asylum seekers and crew died at sea. Of those, more than 600 lost their lives in the last three years, according to the report.

"To do nothing is unacceptable -- so we have proposed a new approach. One that is comprehensive, integrated and equitable," said refugee expert and panel member Paris Aristotle.

In a statement, Amnesty International's refugee spokesman Graham Thom said he was "appalled" by the panel's recommendations.

"Sending asylum seekers to places like Malaysia, Nauru and Papua New Guinea is unacceptable and a complete outsourcing of Australia's human rights obligations.

"The 'Pacific Solution' was a failed policy, and a wildly expensive one, that was internationally condemned for breaching the human rights of some of the world's most vulnerable people," he added.

Manne said it was questionable whether Nauru would meet the requirements to be considered as a legally viable option for offshore asylum centers.

"Although Nauru and PNG have signed the Refugee Convention, neither country has its own laws in place to protect refugees nor are there any proper legal guarantees that refugees would be protected, and there are serious concerns about human rights conditions on the ground," he said.

Australia's politicians have long been at odds over the country's official response to asylum seekers. While the opposition Coalition has backed the reopening of offshore centers, the move has been fiercely resisted by the Greens party which claims it breaches human rights.

In late June, the senate rejected the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012 which would have allowed Australia to send asylum seekers to Malaysia and Nauru for processing. Gillard said she is willing to compromise further to reach agreement and a policy on the issue.

The panel estimated that if all the report's recommendations were adopted, they would cost US$1 billion to implement.
(CNN)  -- A superb goal from Mesut Ozil on the hour mark saw Germany go through to the last 16 of the World Cup with a 1-0 win over Ghana at Soccer City on Wednesday night.

The victory also secures Germany's passage as Group D winners and they will now play England on Sunday in Bloemfontien for a place in the quarterfinals.

Australia beat Serbia 2-1 in Nelspruit but the effort was in vain as Ghana go through as the second qualifier on goal difference.

They are the first African team into the the knockout stages and will face Group C winners the United States on Saturday in Rustenberg.

U.S. and England qualify in Group C

Ozil's superb volleyed strike into the roof of the net gave Joachim Loew's men a deserved victory after having the better of the play, but Ghana also chances in Johannesburg.

In the first half, Andre Ayew looked set to score as he burst into the Germany penalty area, but he took one touch too many, then Ozil was one-on-one with Richard Kingson, but was denied.

Germany captain Philipp Lahm knocked an Asamoah Gyan shot off the line as the teams went in scoreless at halftime, but his team were to eventually triumph.

Coach Loew said he had a word with Ozil in the dressing room about his earlier miss and never doubted he would make amends.

"I told him in the half-time break -- you've still got a goal in you," he told AFP.

"This was an incredibly intense game and not many things worked out for us. But ultimately we have now reached the next stage.

"The round of 16 game (against England) will be a class encounter, we are looking forward to it."

Australia 2-1 Serbia

Serbia only needed a point in the other match to go through, but were undone by a fighting performance by the Socceroos at the Mbombela Stadium.

Two goals in four minutes midway through the second half from Everton midfelder Tim Cahill and substitute Brett Holman gave Australia hope they they could also qualify.

But Serbian substitute Marko Pantelic pulled one back with six minutes left, had another ruled off for offside -- the second of the match for his unfortunatle team -- then shot over the bar with the goal at his mercy.

Serbia also had strong penalty claims denied as Cahill appeared to handle in his own penalty area.

"This was a game of good quality. I cannot reproach any of my players for their effort," Serbian coach Radomir Antic told AFP.

"We had plenty of opportunities but in the end I think that we didn't get fair treatment. We deserved much more than we got. We have to go back home now."

Milos Krasic missed two great scoring chances in the first half and also had an effort ruled out of offside as Serbia dominated, but Australia improved after the break with Cahill outjumping Nemanja Vidic for their opener.

When Holman converted with a long-range strike an unlikely passage to the last 16 looked on the cards, but at the final whistle both teams were disappointed.
NEW YORK (CNN) -- Legendary football coach and broadcaster John Madden is retiring, he announced Thursday.

John Madden appears at the TV Critics Association Press Tour in Beverly Hills, California, in 2008.

"It's been such a great ride ... the NFL has been my life for more than 40 years, it has been my passion -- it still is," he said in a statement released by NBC Sports.

Madden, 73, was a Hall of Fame coach for the Oakland Raiders, but is best known to millions as an ebullient football commentator.

He won 16 Emmy awards for outstanding sports analyst/personality, NBC said.
(CNN) -- Gary Johnson says there are three keys to his campaign being successful: he needs you to know who he is, he needs to be on the ballot in as many states as possible and he needs other libertarians to support him.

And for the next two months, Johnson, the Libertarian party candidate for president and acknowledged underdog, will be zig-zagging across the country to make those admittedly unique goals a reality.

That is the thrust of his argument: Once you get to know me, I swear you'll like me.

Johnson has fashioned himself the "clear alternative" to Republican candidate Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama in November's presidential election.

The most recent CNN/ORC International poll shows that 3% of likely voters and 4% of registered voters say they'd vote for Johnson. But the fact he is even included in a poll is enough to get Johnson excited.

"It is one thing if it gets reported that I am at 4% nationally," said Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico, "but I don't think I go down when people take a look at who I am and what I have done, I think it actually goes up."

And in some ways, he has proof to back that up.

Johnson first ran for governor of New Mexico -- a state with a majority of Democratic voters -- in 1994 as a Republican. He won in the Republican primary, defeating three other Republicans, and then defeated an incumbent Democratic governor by 10 points. After four years in office, Johnson ran again and won in 1998.

Johnson's popularity remained consistently high through his time as governor, leading one paper to remark that he was "arguably the most popular governor of the decade."

CNN Poll: Could Gary Johnson be spoiler?

But he has his work cut out for him. The most notable third party presidential contenders are from the 1800s -- John Tyler, Andrew Johnson -- and even they were largely independents because their original parties disowned them.

The last third-party presidential candidate to make a significant run at the White House was Ross Perot in 1992. He ultimately carried no states and earned 19,743,821 votes. In 2000, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader was labeled as a "spoiler" after getting nearly 100,000 votes in Florida. He was seen by some as siphoning votes away from Democratic candidate Al Gore, who ultimately lost to George W. Bush in the closest election in modern U.S. history.

And Johnson, who first announced his candidacy as a Republican, only switched to Libertarian when his campaign failed to gain much traction during the primaries. He has huge burdens when it comes to fund-raising -- he had only $14,265 in cash on hand at the start of August -- and in organization, with a passionate but small collection of staff and volunteers in a handful of states.

And then there's name recognition: Gary who?

Still, Johnson believes he can defy the odds and make the unlikely climb.

"I just need to catch a wave by the middle of October and awareness for me is a plus," Johnson told CNN. "I do think that I have a resume to back up everything that I am talking about."

Johnson says he is more liberal than Obama on social issues and more conservative than Romney on fiscal issues. He says same-sex marriage is a constitutional issue and should be legal, he supports legalizing marijuana usage and he says he would abolish the Internal Revenue Service.

The third-party candidate is optimistic and is devoting large sums of his own money to make this campaign possible -- much of which came from Big J Enterprises, his mechanical contracting business in New Mexico.

But what Johnson's here-is-what-we-have-to-do optimism fails to clearly show is the daunting challenge in front of him.

Johnson's ballot access gospel

Johnson is proud that he is likely going to be on the ballot in 47 states, even if that status is being challenged in three states -- Oklahoma, Michigan and Pennsylvania.

Before being asked, Johnson brings the ballot access issue up to differentiate himself from other third-party candidates, like the Green Party's Jill Stein.

"No other third party is going to come close to this 50 ballot access," Johnson says proudly. "I am a clear alternative to the other two and I want to point out that we are going to be on the ballot in all 50 states."

Johnson sees the struggles to get on the ballots as a badge of honor. "We should take it as a compliment," he said, that the party establishment doesn't want him on the ballot.

Compliment or not -- even if you are on the ballot, people have to know who you are.

Hi, my name is Gary Johnson

Fighting for ballot access and libertarian support are all for naught, however, unless Johnson is able to introduce himself to the American people, his campaign admits.

At the heart of this introduction are the three prime-time presidential debates.

"The only way I am (going to be) president of the United States is if I am in the national debate between Obama and Romney," Johnson said. "If that takes place, then anything is possible."

The last time a third-party candidate was included in the presidential debates was 1992, when Perot, an independent businessman, was running for president. And due to the fact that the three presidential debates have been announced without Johnson's inclusion, the candidate admits it isn't likely he will be included.

"It is absolutely an uphill battle," Johnson said, "but that is the only scenario by which I could actually win."

But Johnson isn't putting all his stock in being included in the debates. He is taking his message on the road, hitting 16 college towns around the country in the next few weeks.

In the statement announcing the trip, Johnson touches upon the importance of the youth vote -- and in particular, the way young voters were inspired by another libertarian, Rep. Ron Paul.

A Libertarian courting Libertarians

It is unusual that the Libertarian candidate for president is being forced to court other libertarians, but that's exactly what Johnson has to do with the unflinchingly loyal base of libertarians who support former Republican hopeful Ron Paul. According to Johnson, the Paul supporters are "absolutely pivotal" to his success.

Johnson acts surprised that he has to do this, too. "Where does his support go?" the former governor asks. "To Mitt Romney? To Barack Obama? Or to me?"

Libertarians are a unique set of voters. While they agree on some things -- individual freedoms, the right to do what you want without government coercion and a generally liberal social policy -- they also share a fierce independent streak. That independence, which largely stems from the desire to make their own decisions, makes the libertarian movement less of a cohesive group and more of a set of factions exchanging ideas.

When making his pitch to Paul supporters, Johnson lists a litany of positions on which he and the former candidate agree. "I don't want to bomb Iran, I want to bring the troops home, I want to end the drug war," Johnson says quickly. "I want to end the Patriot Act, I want to balance the federal budget tomorrow and I want to abolish the IRS."

But many Paul supporters don't see those issues as that black-and-white. Reaction to Johnson's candidacy has been tepid and varied.

"He is ok. He is definitely very close," said Mike Salvi, a Ron Paul grassroots organizer.

"Gary is very much in line with Dr. Paul on many issues," said Jordan Page, a performer who traveled with the Paul campaign. "(It's) the first time we have had a viable third party candidate."

"I am not sure if I will vote for Gary Johnson," said Danny Panzella, another Paul grassroots organizer. "I don't see him as a principle Libertarian."

Johnson endorsed Paul in 2008, when the Texas congressman was running for president, and when Johnson dropped out of the race as a Republican in 2012, he urged his supporters to vote for Paul in the Republican primaries.

So far though, Paul has yet to give Johnson much support in 2012.

"We don't have contact with the Ron Paul campaign," Johnson said bluntly. "I am not asking for his endorsement and I don't expect his endorsement."

The tension between Paul and Johnson is evidence of a larger split among libertarians. Paul commanded such a loyal following, that with his political career dwindling, there is power vacuum in the movement right now. With Johnson as the party's candidate, he is trying to position himself as the group's heir apparent.

"I am the Libertarian nominee for president," Johnson said. "I am now the spokesperson for the movement."
(CNN) -- Help trickled in Thursday, three days after a magnitude-7.7 earthquake struck off Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that has killed at least 311 people and left more than 400 missing.

An assessment team from the nonprofit group SurfAid International had reached the disaster zone, but the area's remoteness prevented further contact with headquarters in Sumatera Barat, Indonesia.

SurfAid had shipped 1,000 shelter kits to victims, and is preparing to send more supplies once communication is established, spokeswoman Jossi Syahrial said Thursday.

The group was trying to work with government officials to establish an information and coordination hub for all non-governmental organizations, she said.

The hard-hit Mentawai Islands region is among Indonesia's myriad islands.

"It's very difficult" to reach the region either by boat or road, said Andrew Judge, CEO of SurfAid.

The trip takes at least 10 hours in good conditions, according to aid agencies.

The Indonesian Red Cross also had sent at least two aid teams. One aid shipment included about 400 body bags.

Urgent needs are expected to include clean water, food, blankets, clothing, medical attention, emergency shelter and hygiene kits, said Ita Balanda, a program manager for the World Vision aid organization in Padang, Indonesia.

An estimated 7,900 households were affected, she said.

"The worst hit area is North and South Pagai Island. Reports of villages flattened are coming from there," said Antorizon of the West Sumatra disaster management agency, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.

The first pictures from North Pagai Island showed damaged and flattened structures.

Monday's quake generated a "significant" tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. Some of the missing might include people who are unaccounted for after fleeing to higher ground, said Henri Dori Satoko, head of the Mentawai Islands parliament.

Though communication poses a challenge in the remote area, some witnesses in West Sumatra reported seeing a wave 6 meters (nearly 20 feet) high. Other reports described the tsunami as being about 3 meters (almost 10 feet) high.

At least one village with a population of about 200 people was swept away, with only 40 people recovered, Satoko said.

The quake struck at 9:42 p.m. Monday, triggering a tsunami warning. Its epicenter was 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of Padang, at a depth of 20.6 kilometers (12.8 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The magnitude was revised upward from a preliminary magnitude of 7.5.

"On Mentawai, a [tsunami] warning was issued seven minutes after detection of earthquake, which is what the existing system is capable of doing. Preliminary report indicates the destructive waves hit the Mentawai Islands after five minutes. ... For Mentawai villagers, the warning is late, as they are very close to the tsunami source," said Sanny Jegillos of the U.N. Development Programme. He oversees the Indian Ocean tsunami warning system, including Indonesia.

Indonesia's government has since warned residents of West Sumatra province to stay alert and stay away from the coastline for up to five days because of the possibility of more earthquakes, Balanda said.

The city of Padang and the Mentawai Islands are at the meeting place of two tectonic plates, making them vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis.

On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off northern Sumatra. A tsunami generated by that earthquake killed more than 225,000 people in 14 countries -- mainly India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The Indonesian region of Banda Aceh was hard-hit: About 150,000 died there.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- Italian football manager Carlo Ancelotti has gone from Milan to London in less than a day.

Carlo Ancelotti will take over as manager of Chelsea from July 1 this year.

Just 24 hours after resigning from his highly-successful eight-year stint at Italy's AC Milan, he has been announced as the new manager of English Premier League club Chelsea -- replacing temporary manager Guus Hiddink.

Chelsea, who won the FA Cup at the weekend, were looking for a permanent manager for the start of next season -- and Ancelotti has been signed on a three-year deal to the west-London club.

A statement on Chelsea's web site read: "Carlo was the outstanding candidate for the job. He has proved over a long period his ability to build teams that challenged for, and have been successful in, major domestic and European competitions."

Ancelotti, who turns 50 next week, has been in management since 1995, when he took charge of Italian Serie B club Reggiana. Although he only spent one season at Reggiana, he managed to earn them promotion to the top-flight Serie A league. Since then he has managed Parma and Juventus, before taking on the San Siro-based giants AC Milan.

Is Ancelotti's appointment the right move for Chelsea? Tell us in the Sound Off box below.

As a manager he has enjoyed plenty of success, particularly in his time at the Rossoneri. He steered Milan to the Coppa Italia in 2003, the Serie A title in 2003--04, the UEFA Champions League in both 2002--03 and 2006--07, the UEFA Super Cup in 2003 and 2007 and the FIFA Club World Cup crown in 2007.

Before entering management, Ancelotti had a significant playing career as a midfielder with AS Roma and AC Milan. During his time at both clubs he amassed three Serie A titles, two European Cups, and he also won the Coppa Italia four times with Roma.

He is one of only six people to ever win the Champions League as both a player and manager -- a list which includes current Barcelona manager and this year's winner, Josep Guardiola.

Ancelotti also represented Italy on 26 occasions, scoring once. He played in the 1986 and 1990 World Cups alongside players such as Roberto Mancini and the recently-retired Paolo Maldini.

Despite his management success at AC Milan, it has been widely reported that his relationship with the club's owner, Silvio Berlusconi, has not been strong in 2009.

He takes over at Chelsea as the permanent replacement for Luiz Felipe Scolari, although Guus Hiddink has been in charge since Scolari was sacked from Stamford Bridge in February.
(CNN) -- Bayern Munich's record winning start to the Bundesliga season came to an abrupt end Sunday as they were stunned 2-1 at home by Bayer Leverkusen.

Going into the match at the Allianz Arena, Bayern had racked up eight straight wins, but a late own goal by their German international defender Jerome Boateng saw them slip to defeat.

They still have a four-point lead at the top from Schalke, while Leverkusen have moved up to fifth.

The visitors took the lead when Andre Schuerrle left striker Stefan Kiessling with a close range tap-in after 42 minutes.

Bayern drew level with 13 minutes remaining as striker Mario Mandzukic headed home, but Leverkusen were to enjoy their first win in Munich since 1989.

Boateng's attempted to head away a shot but it just flew past goalkeeper Manuel Neuer on 86 minutes.

In other action, Eintracht Frankfurt missed the chance to move back above Schalke when they lost 2-1 at Stuttgart.

Snow can't stop Dortmund victory

Vedad Ibisevic scored Stuttgart's winner for the second straight week. Alexander Meier had leveled for Frankfurt after Christian Gentner's sixth-minute opener for the home side .

Borussia Moenchengladbach came from two down to score three late goals in a 3-2 win at Hanover.

In Serie A, champions Juventus maintained their lead at the top with a controversial 1-0 win at Catania, who finished with 10 men.

Chilean star Arturo Vidal put Juve ahead after 57 minutes before Catania defender Giovanni Marchese was sent off mid-way through the second half.

But the real arguments came in the first half as Catania thought they had gone ahead when Argentine striker Ruben Bergessio tapped home a rebound.

The referee ruled it out to the fury of the home side and their president Antonino Pulvirenti, who was sent from the bench for dissent.

Inter Milan kept up their pursuit of the Old Lady with their fifth straight win, 3-2 at Bologna to stay four points behind.

Andrea Ranocchia and Diego Milito put Inter 2-0 ahead before Nicolo Cherubin hit back for the home side.

Esteban Cambiasso's first goal of the season sealed three points for the Nerazzurri.

In La Liga, Atletico Madrid drew level on points with Barcelona at the top as man of the moment Radamel Falcao scored his 10th league goal of the season in their 3-1 win over Osasuna.

Joao Miranda and Raul Garcia put Atletico 2-0 ahead in the Vincente Calderon Stadium before Roland Lamah pulled one back for Osasuna, who stay bottom of the table.

Falcao sealed the three points 17 minutes from time.

In the late match, reigning champions Real Madrid won 5-0 in Mallorca with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuain both scoring twice.

But they remained eight points adrift of the leading pair in fourth place.
Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A radical Islamic cleric who faced charges relating to terrorism was killed in a daylight ambush Monday morning in Kenya's main coastal city, Mombasa, Kenya Police said.

Aboud Rogo Mohammed was accused supporting Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia and was blacklisted by the United States and U.N. Security Council. He also faced charges before a Kenyan court for planning terror attacks in Mombasa

"We have received reports that Aboud Rogo Mohammed has died," said Eric Kiraithe, the Kenya Police spokesman. "We are taking this matter very seriously. It is disappointing to us, because we had a case in court and we had evidence to go to its logical conclusion."

But Rogo's wife, Hania Said, claimed the shooters were Kenyan police.

Kiraithe dismissed that claim and asked for the public to give the police information.

"That can only be nonsense," he said. "For what conceivable reason would that happen? What we need is for everyone to cooperate without any fear. We have a witness protection program now."

Rogo's wife said the cleric was traveling with his family in a van on the Mombasa-Malindi highway when they were ambushed by a group of men who shot her husband more than a dozen times.

She said she was shot in the leg and Rogo's father was shot in the hand.

Their van, a 14-seat white Nissan, was riddled with bullets and splattered with blood. Police tried to take away Rogo's body, but a group of supporters refused and took it away to be buried in the Muslim public cemetery.

The shooting sparked protests by Mombasa's Muslim community. Anti-riot police responded with tear gas. A government vehicle was burned near a mosque where Rogo once preached.

A U.N. report in July said that Rogo "threatened the peace, security, or stability of Somalia, by providing financial, material, logistical or technical support to Al-Shabaab."

It went on to claim that he was a key recruiter of Kenyan Muslims to fight with Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group that is trying to overthrow the Somali government.

(CNN) -- The popular uprising in Syria against the Alawi-led minority regime of Bashar al-Assad poses a serious challenge to U.S. national security in the Middle East.

As it fights for its survival amid escalating violence, the Syrian regime risks not only the deepening of civil strife in the country, but also provoking sectarian strife in the region, potentially drawing in U.S. military involvement. Washington has thus far been cautious in dealing with Syria, favoring strong words and sanctions against the regime and supporting Arab efforts to stop the violent military crackdown. But this could change as conditions in Syria deteriorate.

The recent arrival in Syria of Arab observers, as part of a Syrian-endorsed Arab League plan to stop the violence, has been met with mixed emotions. Syrian opposition members rejected the plan, which was mediated by Iraq, on the grounds that it will give the bestial regime another chance to continue its brutal policies.

Syria pipeline attached amid ongoing killing

Burhan Ghalioun, the head of the Syrian National Council opposition movement, emphasized that the observers cannot do their work because "they cannot go where the authorities don't want them to go." The Arab League's initiative is further tainted by the contemptible presence of Sudanese Gen. Mohammad Ahmed Mustafa al-Dabi, who heads the mission. Al-Dabi held high military intelligence and security positions in the government of President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted on international charges of genocide in Darfur.

Meanwhile, Syria continues its slow, steady descent into sectarian strife. There is the militarization of segments of the opposition, as manifested by the creation of the Free Syrian Army, and the targeted sectarian murders committed in mixed towns, especially in Homs. Indeed, the recent twin suicide bombings in Damascus, regardless of the identity of the as-yet-unknown culprits, could well be a portent of what may happen in the multireligious, multiethnic country. This premonition of escalating violence is shared by many in the region, including those within the ranks of the Syrian opposition.

Syria is tightly linked both to the evolving Arab politics -- as influenced by the past year's Arab popular uprisings -- and to the ongoing shifts in the Saudi and Iranian-led regional axes of powers that have resulted from withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.

To be sure, it is the Arab League mission that reflects more the deep divisions splintering the Arab world: The Arab League, led by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, initially determined to pressure the autocratic Syrian regime into submission, but this resolve was weakened by Iraq questioning the League's apparent double-standard policy. Its stance on Syria contrasts sharply with its position on Bahrain.

Saudi Arabia, along with other Gulf Cooperation Council countries, sent troops to Bahrain to help quash a Shi'a majority-dominated uprising against that kingdom's Sunni monarchy.

Similarly, the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, acting apparently in concert with Iran, has not concealed its desire to keep the Syrian regime in power. Iran has described the violence in Syria as part of a Western-Israeli conspiracy against the regime. And pro-Iranian forces in Iraq and Lebanon, such as the Sadrists and Hezbollah respectively, have expressed their readiness to support the Syrian regime.

Beyond this, the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq has apparently boosted the confidence not only of Iran and its proxies but also the Syrian regime.

Iran and Hezbollah laud the "resistance" for forcing the Americans from Iraq, and Syria no longer fears an American interference from Iraq. In fact, the regime believes that Iraq now affords Syria another strategic buffer with regard to a potential anti-Syrian military intervention; the other being offered by Lebanon.

This will undoubtedly leave the international community facing neither an Arab nor a Russian solution. Russia recently introduced a draft resolution the U.N. Security Council on ending the violence in Syria. However, Russia, along with China, has had serious disagreements with other members of the Security Council, who favor sanctions against Damascus, including an arms embargo.

Washington will most likely confront urgent Arab and Syrian opposition requests for direct involvement in Syria. Already, Ghalioun has called on the Security Council to adopt the Arab initiative; at the same time some Arab and Syrian opposition leaders have vocally called for a no-fly zone and NATO involvement to protect civilians.

But a word of caution. The danger of this kind of involvement lies in the grave and complex reality that Iran still considers the security of the Syrian regime as part of its own security, and that, while both Tehran and Damascus have been preparing for a conflict with United States since its invasion of Iraq in 2003, including supporting proxy forces in the region, Washington has thus far pursued policies more reactive in nature to regional developments. Washington should be careful about falling into the duplicitous trap of Middle Eastern politics.

Washington must act within the context that Syria is already in the throes of civil strife, which can only intensify and possibly spill over into Lebanon or Iraq, and that the Arab states are fighting two wars. One is over the nature of future power in their capitals and the other is over which regional axis they will support.

Washington should also disabuse itself of the notion that the terminally ill Syrian regime will collapse soon. The regime has life support from Iran, Iraq and Lebanon, and thrives on terror and Arab schisms. This makes any reactive or reflexive American involvement in Syria fraught with uncertainties and serious risks.

Washington's policies should focus now on expanding and organizing its cooperation with Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which have deep interest in a change of power in Damascus; supporting the Free Syrian Army through Saudi Arabia and Turkey; strengthening sanctions against Syria in concert with regional and international allies, including placing sanctions on Sunni merchants closely associated with the regime.; maintaining and supporting a strong diplomatic presence in Iraq and Lebanon; seeking out Alawi and Christian political and military figures with the objective of reassuring them with the promise of political inclusion in the future of Syria.

Most importantly, Washington should not lead a campaign in Syria designed in the imperial corridors of the American capital itself.

Washington (CNN) -- As President Obama is set to take stock of the nation during his State of the Union address Tuesday, a civil engineers group gives the U.S. transportation system low grades.

For example, the nation's bridges. Most of us don't think much about bridges until one we need is closed or is damaged or collapses, as the I-35W one did in Minneapolis in 2007, killing 13 people.

Yet engineers all over the country who really know about such things say we ought to be thinking about bridges a lot more.

And here is something we should consider: One in four of our bridges is either in need of repair or obsolete in terms of handling modern traffic and loads.

That startling fact comes from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which every few years consults with dozens of the nation's experts on all sorts of infrastructure matters. The society gives U.S. bridges a grade of C.

And bridges aren't the only problem in what we could call the State of the Union's Infrastructure. Roads, airports, water supplies, railways, dams, schools and on and on it goes; all are, according to the engineers' latest report in 2009, in pretty dire shape.

The amount of air travel in the U.S. increased by 7% last year, but an overhaul of the air travel infrastructure is long overdue, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. The group gave the nation's aviation system a grade of D.  Compared with trucks, railways are much more efficient for moving goods: using about 20% less energy per mile if used properly. But comparatively little has been invested in expanding U.S. railroad capacity. Rail gets a C minus.   What is the state of your community? Tell us

Consider this: Although a steady drinking water supply is crucial to even the most basic success, water systems nationwide are so old and decrepit that the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates 7 billion gallons of drinking water are being lost through leaky pipes every day.

How can America save crumbling water delivery systems?

Inland shipping along canals and rivers keeps millions of American homes warm with coal and families fed with grains such as wheat and corn. But locks on canals and rivers, which were made to last only 50 years, are now on average 60 years old. Navigable waterways get a D minus from the civil engineers.   See details of the ASCE report card

Public transit use grew 25 percent in the past 10 years, and yet fully half of all Americans have no access to commuter buses or trains; many more have sketchy access at best.  You get the picture. However, it may be a little harder to see the multiplying effect.

Experts at the American Society of Civil Engineers point out that for each year that these infrastructure problems are not addressed, they grow exponentially worse.

It's kind of like a leak in the roof. It may be painful to pay for new shingles when the leak is small, but if you wait until it expands and soaks the walls and floors below, the damage and cost will be much, much harder to bear.

In recent years, many politicians have started talking much more seriously about infrastructure problems, but when faced with a stumbling economy, they are finding it harder than ever before to lean into big-ticket repairs.   After all, until the day comes that a bridge falls down, it often looks just fine.

The problem is, no one really knows which day that will be.
Sebastian Vettel's run of four successive victories ended on Sunday, but the German's remarkable drive in Abu Dhabi kept him in pole position to become Formula One's youngest triple world champion.

After being disqualified from Saturday's qualifying due to a technical infringement, the Red Bull star was allowed to start from the pit lane -- but still managed to finish third after one of the most chaotic races this season.

His heroic showing overshadowed Kimi Raikkonen's first victory since 2009, and ended the Finn's slim hopes of a second world title ahead of the final two races.

Vettel's lead was cut by three points to 10 as main rival Fernando Alonso finished second for Ferrari, and the Spaniard said he was happy after improving from sixth on the starting grid.

Latest F1 standings

"We were not super competitive this weekend. We had to fight through the laps, then we had a good strategy that gave us a chance for the victory, but second was the maximum," Alonso said.

The top three benefited by the withdrawal of Lewis Hamilton, who seemed set for his first victory since Monza in September as he raced clear.

However, the 2008 world champion suffered yet another mechanical problem as his McLaren developed fuel pressure problems -- it was the second time in five races the Englishman has retired while leading.

"I'm gutted. I feel certain we could have won," said Hamilton, who will switch to the Mercedes team next year.

"I was just entering a corner and the car just died on me. I was cruising and still pulling away when I had my problem."

Vettel's hopes seemed bleak early in the race after he twice made contact with other cars and suffered minor damage -- but that was nothing compared to the scrapes in which his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber was involved.

The safety car was called out twice, which worked in Vettel's favor, and Webber failed to finish after tangles with Williams' Pastor Maldonado and Ferrari's Felipe Massa and then a terminal shunt from Sauber's Sergio Perez which also took out Lotus' Romain Grosjean.

"The second safety car helped, then I had a nice fight with Jenson (Button). It was a thrilling grand prix, up and down all the time," said Vettel, who won in Abu Dhabi in 2009-10 but retired last year with his second world title already in the bag.

"There are still two races to go. We saw how things can change yesterday. There was a chance we could screw it up, but we didn't do that."

Webber's DNF meant that Red Bull will have to wait another race before clinching a third successive manufacturers' title -- holding a lead of 82 points over Ferrari with 86 still on offer.

Jenson Button helped McLaren stay third as he finished fourth ahead of Maldonado, while Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi improved his hopes of another season at Sauber by placing sixth.

Massa, who has had his Ferrari contract extended by another year, was seventh ahead of Bruno Senna -- who gave Williams a second driver in the top 10 despite an early collision with Sauber-bound Nico Hulkenberg.

Force India's Paul di Resta was ninth after his teammate Hulkenberg's early exit while Toro Rosso's Daniel Ricciardo -- who earned Vettel's anger after causing him front-wing damage -- was 10th.

Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion, delivered Lotus' first victory this season as he continued a consistent return to F1 that has put him third in the overall standings -- but now 57 points behind Vettel with only 50 points available.

"It's been a hard season, not an easy time, but hopefully this gives us more belief," said Raikkonen, who will stay at Lotus for the second year of his contract.

"I hope this can turn the tables and give us many more wins, if not this year then for next year."
(CNN) -- Edward Dolman is Christie's first chief executive officer to have been a specialist, who understands the pressure and the nature of valuing art. Part of his mission is attracting other highly motivated specialists into their business.

A Christie's employee stands beside a painting  at Christie's auction house in London on July 4.

Dolman was born in London in 1960 and attended Dulwich College from 1971-1978, before studying History of Art at Southampton University.

He later completed a degree at the Study Centre for Fine and Decorative Arts, which had a close relationship with the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Not being of blue-blood birth, he joined Christie's because of the link with Christie's South Kensington, starting out as a porter in the furniture department.

After a year he assumed the role of specialist in the furniture department of South Kensington, where he would see everything from European to Chinese furniture in the high-volume saleroom over the next 10 years.

Meanwhile he became an auctioneer, doing a number of off-site sales at country estates and traveling to France and Belgium to generate business in the middle market of furniture.

At that time he was on the Management Committee, and South Kensington began to do great sales. Finally in 1995, he decided he wanted to become a manager and took a course at the Institute of Directors in the Mall to learn the language of business and the motivation of people.

Dolman was subsequently made Managing Director of Christie's Amsterdam, applying new techniques and marketing to enhance interest in high-quality art.

Twenty months later he returned to Christie's London on King Street as the Commercial Director to run Christie's Europe. As he attempted to develop new categories to win business, he was made Managing Director.

In 1999 Dolman moved to New York as the International Managing Director and later as Chief Executive. Together with Christie's International Management Group, they developed an intensive five-year business plan, and Dolman took over from Christopher Davidge, as approved by Francois Pinault.
(CNN) -- Boston was strong. Too strong for the St. Louis Cardinals.

The Red Sox, defeated the Cardinals 6-1 on Wednesday to win their eighth World Series title and cap a wicked good worst-to-first season that delighted a city dealing with the aftermath of the deadly bombings at its signature marathon in April.

Shane Victorino drove in four runs with a bases-loaded double in the third and an RBI single in the fourth as Boston took the Series four games to two.

Series MVP David Ortiz, walked four times -- three times intentionally -- and scored two runs for the Red Sox.

A resurgent John Lackey pitched six strong innings before fading in the seventh and leaving with the bases loaded with a 6-1 lead. But reliever Junichi Tazawa got out Allen Craig to blunt the Cardinals' comeback attempt.

In April at a remembrance ceremony for the victims of the bombing, it was Ortiz, known as Big Papi, who fired up the crowd.

"This jersey, that we wear today, it doesn't say 'Red Sox.' It says 'Boston,' " Ortiz said, standing on the infield as the crowd cheered officers who were on the field.

"We want to thank you Mayor (Tom) Menino, Gov. (Deval) Patrick, the whole police department, for the great job that they did this past week. This is our f***ing city. And nobody's going to dictate our freedom. Stay strong," he said, echoing the newly minted "Boston Strong" motto.

The Red Sox became only the second team in major league history to finish last in their division in one season and win the World Series the next year. In 1991, two worst-to-first teams met in the World Series with the Minnesota Twins edging the Atlanta Braves in seven games.

It's the club's third World Series title in the last 10 seasons -- albeit the first that they've celebrated on their home field since 1918.
Cologne, Germany (CNN) -- More than 340,000 gamers from across Europe converged in this quaint German city last month to get their first hands-on with Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One consoles and to preview an assortment of new games.

The occasion was Gamescom, the massive video gaming show that attracted over 600 exhibitors from upwards of 80 countries, all of whom set up booths in 10 massive halls that featured over 1.4 million square feet of space. It was like E3 and Comic-Con, only much bigger.

Big companies like Sony, Microsoft, Ubisoft and Electronic Arts kicked off the festivities with press conferences that featured exclusive announcements, including the November 15 PS4 launch date and new games such as "The Sims 4."

Europe plays an important role in the global gaming ecosystem, thanks to the success of such European companies as Rovio Entertainment ("Angry Birds"), DICE ("Battlefield 4") and TT Games ("The LEGO Movie Game"). According to Peter Warman, founder of video-game research firm Newzoo, European consumers will contribute 23% of the $70.4 billion global video game market this year.

"The most talked-about companies over the past year are European," said Warman. "Companies like SuperCell ("Clash of Clans"), Wargaming ("World of Tanks"), Mojang ("Minecraft") and King ("Candy Crush") will bring in a combined revenue of more than $1.5 billion this year."

Next-generation gaming was a huge focus this year, but the current crop of consoles still have a lot of life left in them. And the PC, which has always been strong in Europe, remains a force as well. Here are five games that stood out from the very crowded booths of Gamescom 2013.

'Fighter Within' -- Ubisoft/Daoka; Xbox One; Fall 2013

Developer Daoka is making the most of the new Xbox One Kinect technology with this fighting game, which you control by moving your arms and legs. Thanks to the enhanced motion sensors and tracking capabilities, players' moves are represented on a one-to-one basis within the game. This means that every punch, kick and counter in the real world will be faithfully replicated.

Players can choose from an assortment of fighters, each with distinct and authentic fighting styles and special moves. The game supports two-player competitive play, which means friends will be standing next to one another in the real world while they pummel their opponent in the virtual one.

'The Sims 4' -- Electronic Arts/EA Maxis; PC; 2014

With over 175 million copies of "The Sims" sold so far, EA Maxis is making this simulation franchise more life-like than ever before by utilizing new technology. The franchise has evolved over the years to incorporate more human behaviors into its virtual characters. Each Sim now has a rich emotional center that drives meaningful social interactions with those they interact with. Players can explore deeper stories with these more human simulations.

Gameplay revolves around life's tragedies and triumphs, with the ability to customize everything from Sims' homes to their lifetime aspirations. The core game mechanics have worked for over a decade now. The genius has been adding new gameplay and content, through expansion packs and sequels, and making the connections between human and Sim evolve over time.

'Dead Island Epidemic' -- Deep Silver/Stunlock Studios; PC; TBD

Developer Stunlock Studios is expanding Techland's popular zombie franchise by exploring a new genre with this free-to-play PC MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game, which strands players on a tropical island overrun with zombies. Three teams of four players will battle against each other over control of strategic positions. There will also be a wide assortment of zombies and undead creatures to contend with, the larger ones requiring all three teams to work together.

Players can customize their own weapons from hundreds of items they collect in the game, making for a unique action-packed experience. This game stands out from the very crowded MOBA genre ("Dota 2," "League of Legends," "Heroes of Newerth," "Infinite Crisis") with its rare combination of zombies and over-the-top action.

'Fable Legends' -- Microsoft/Lionhead Studios; Xbox One; TBD

Lionhead Studios returns to the fantasy world of Albion with this Xbox One-exclusive adventure. For the first time, up to four players can embark on quests together as they build their characters, explore photorealistic lands and face off against monsters and assorted bad guys. The game's been designed for seamless solo play as well.

For the first time in the franchise, players can forgo their heroic calling and become a villain instead -- complete with an army of minions. The game utilizes the Xbox Smartglass experience through any tablet by opening up a second screen on which villains can battle heroes while sitting next to each other on the couch.

'The Order: 1886' -- Sony/Ready at Dawn; PlayStation 4; TBD

One of the more unique next-generation action games on display at Gamescom, "The Order" provides an alternate vision of Victorian-era London. Players join an elite order of knights and jump into a centuries-old battle between good and evil in this PS4 exclusive. The game's world blends real historical figures, places and events with myths like the Arthurian legend.

Developer Ready at Dawn has brought advanced Industrial Revoluton weaponry to the fray, allowing players to better fight mysterious supernatural enemies. The entire experience has a cinematic feel, and the game's presentation even replicates the texture of film. With its foreboding atmosphere and action-heavy gameplay, "The Order" stands out from the crowd.
(CNN) -- An airplane baggage screener faces dismissal for leaving a note in a passenger's bag that said "Get Your Freak On, Girl" after discovering a vibrator.

The Transportation Security Administration "has initiated action to remove the individual from federal service," an agency spokesperson said. "Like all federal employees, this individual is entitled to due process and protected by the Privacy Act. During the removal action process, the employee will not perform any screening duties."

The agency randomly selects checked baggage for screening on flights originating in the United States. Lawyer and writer Jill Filipovic tweeted a picture of the note Monday and later blogged about it on Feministe.

"This is what TSA will do when they inspect a bag you checked and find a, um, 'personal item,' " she wrote. "Total violation of privacy, wildly inappropriate and clearly not OK, but I also just died laughing in my hotel room."

The TSA identified and removed the employee from screening operations, the TSA said Wednesday on its blog. After completing an investigation, action was initiated to remove the individual from federal service.

"TSA views the handwritten note to be highly inappropriate and unprofessional and apologizes for this unfortunate incident," the spokesperson said. "TSA has zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior by our employees as occurred in this instance. When this is brought to our attention TSA takes swift and appropriate action."

An agency official reached out to Filipovic to apologize personally, the agency said. At this point, though, she said she wishes the story would go away.

"It's easy to scapegoat one individual here, but the problem with the note is that it's representative of the bigger privacy intrusions that the U.S. government, through the TSA and other sources, levels every day," she wrote Wednesday after learning of the employee's suspension.

"As much as this is a funny and titillating story, when I put the note on Twitter for what I thought was a relatively limited audience, I was hoping it would open up a bigger conversation about privacy rights (or lack thereof) in post-9/11 America. It unfortunately hasn't done that, and instead has turned into a media circus," she said.

"The note was inappropriate, the agent in question acted unprofessionally when s/he put in my bag, there should be consequences and I'm glad the TSA takes these things seriously. But I get no satisfaction in hearing that someone may be in danger of losing their job over this. I would much prefer a look at why 'security' has been used to justify so many intrusions on our civil liberties, rather than fire a person who made a mistake."
(CNN) -- A top Mexican drug trafficker has been arrested by Mexican police, authorities said Wednesday.

Luis Rodriguez Olivera, alias "El Guero," was arrested at Mexico City's airport Tuesday, federal police said in a statement.

The United States was offering a $5 million reward for information leading to Rodriguez's capture.

Rodriguez, 39, is accused of money laundering and importing, possessing and distributing cocaine into the United States.

According to Mexico's Ministry of Public Security, Rodriguez and his brothers Esteban, Daniel and Miguel were part of a criminal ring known as Los Gueritos, who smuggled drugs into the United States between 1996 and 2008. The crew worked under the leadership of Mexico's most-wanted fugitive, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, the leader of the Sinaloa cartel.

Of the other brothers, Esteban was arrested in 2008, and Miguel was killed in a shootout in August, the ministry said.

The Rodriguez brothers were indicted in New York in 2009 for drug trafficking.

The U.S. State Department offered the hefty reward for Luis Rodriguez's capture. While Mexican authorities said Wednesday that Rodriguez was associated with the Sinaloa cartel, U.S. officials offered a slightly different biography of the trafficker.

According to American authorities, Rodriguez and his gang broke away from El Chapo's federation around 2005 and tried to work independently. Eventually, pressured by the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels, the Rodriguez brothers moved their operations to Leon, Guanajuato, and established a strong relationship with the Zetas drug cartel.

Rodriguez's arrest was the second important drug trafficking arrest made in two weeks.

Last week, Mexican army special forces arrested a top lieutenant for El Chapo.

Troops arrested Felipe Cabrera Sarabia in the northwestern state of Sinaloa.

Cabrera, who was responsible for the activities of the Sinaloa cartel in Durango and the southern part of the state of Chihuahua, was detained after fleeing from Durango, officials said.

He is charged with possessing firearms reserved for use by the army and falsification of a public document, officials said.
WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- U.S. authorities have ratcheted up pressure on one of Mexico's most notorious drug cartels, releasing new details about the so-called Gulf Cartel's operations and offering up to a $50 million reward for the arrest of its leaders.

These are weapons that the Mexican army said it seized from the ruthless Gulf Cartel in 2008.

A federal indictment unsealed Monday charged Miguel Trevino Morales, a leader of the northern Mexico-based Gulf Cartel, of operating a criminal enterprise, cocaine distribution and firearms violations.

Concurrently, prosecutors updated a separate indictment against three other top leaders of the Gulf Cartel: Antonio Cardenas Guillen, Jorge Eduardo Costilla and Heriberto Lazcano, for drug trafficking related crimes, all believed to be at large in Mexico.

Fifteen other suspected cartel members are also named in that indictment.

"We have learned that the most effective way to disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations is to prosecute their leaders and seize their funding," Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer said in a statement.

To that end, the departments of justice, state and treasury are working together to place pressure on the Gulf Cartel and what authorities describe as its ruthless enforcement arm, known as Los Zetas.

The Department of the Treasury designated the four top bosses named in the indictments as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers, which authorizes the freezing of any assets they hold in the United States and other sanctions.

The Gulf Cartel and Zetas, nicknamed collectively as "The Company," are among the major drug cartels that are behind the drug-related violence that has swept Mexico in recent years, according to authorities. Since taking office in 2006, Mexican President Felipe Calderon has made fighting the cartels a major priority.

The group also operates in cities across the United States, authorities said.

The court documents detail telephone conversations between the four leaders and more than a dozen other cartel members allegedly discussing the transportation and smuggling of cocaine and marijuana into the United States.

"These indictments allege a stunning and sophisticated operation by 'The Company' to move illegal drugs into our communities and cash back to Mexico," Breuer said.

The State Department is offering a rewards totaling up to $50 million for information leading to the capture of four top leaders and six other cartel lieutenants.
(CNN) -- Summer is the best time for outdoor musical festivals and blasting music with all the windows open. We've done the legwork for you, and compiled what should be some of the best albums of the season, and the most tent-worthy festivals, organized by region.

Find the ear candy that suits your taste best, and get busy listening:

ALBUMS

Queens of the Stone Age, "... Like Clockwork," due June 4

The band's sixth album, a follow-up to "Era Vulgaris," welcomes founding bassist Nick Oliveri back into the band, and includes guest spots by Dave Grohl, Elton John, Trent Reznor, Mark Lanegan, Brody Dalle and Jake Shears, among others. It's one of the first meaty rock records of the summer and can be heard here.

The Lonely Island, "The Wack Album," due June 11

An anecdote to the oh-so-earnest music out there, Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer are back with the hilarity, with help from friends Solange, Maya Rudolph, T-Pain, Adam Levine, Lady Gaga, Justin Timberlake, Pharrell Williams and more. "Semicolon" is a twisted update of "Schoolhouse Rock," while "Spring Break Anthem" takes bromance to its logical conclusion.

Kanye West, "Yeezus," due June 18

His follow-up to "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" is supposed to be a game-changer -- and we hope that doesn't mean too many Kim Kardashian songs such as "Baby You're Awesome," which he played at the Met Ball and the Adult Swim upfront. A sneak peek of tracks "Black Skinhead" and "New Slaves" on "Saturday Night Live" suggest that he's been listening to a lot of DMX, while his collaborators include Daft Punk, Skrillex, John Legend, members of Odd Future, No I.D., Pusha T and Chief Keef. Potential tracks "I Am a God" and "I Am Not a Celebrity" also suggest 'Ye isn't leaving his ego at the door.

The 20 best summer 2013 movies

Sigur RÃ³s, "Kveikur," due June 18

Now that multi-instrumentalist Kjartan Sveinsson's left to go compose elsewhere, the Icelandic band's sound has transformed from ambient music/dream-rock to something harder and darker, as indicated by first-released tracks "Brennisteinn" and "Isjaki," which venture further into prog-metal. Don't worry, the gorgeous falsettos are still intact.

MGMT, "MGMT," June TBA

The duo's synth-heavy follow-up to "Congratulations" features influences by Aphex Twin and house music and was recorded with longtime Flaming Lips producer Dave Fridmann, which only can mean one thing -- expect it to be trippy. The first sneak peek track, "Alien Days," was released on cassette for Record Store Day last month. The album is expected to include a version of Faine Jade's garage rocker "Introspection" as well as new track "Mystery Disease."

What's new this summer on TV?

Wu-Tang Clan, "A Better Tomorrow," July TBA

For the 20th anniversary of "Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)," the Staten Island hip-hop group has a new and possibly final album, named after their 1997 track, "A Better Tomorrow." RZA told The New York Times that the group has one last mission: "We need to, one time, completely, efficiently, properly represent our brand," while Ghostface Killah told the Guardian, "We got verses and s---, but you gotta make sure it's right. Don't rush it." Take your time.

M.I.A., "Mitangi," summer TBA

The full album was supposed to be out in April, but the Sri Lankan rapper gave us a taste of her new music (outside of last year's"Bad Girls") during Paris Fashion Week for the runway show of the Japanese brand Kenzo. Advance word on "Mitangi" was that it was more upbeat than usual ("Come Walk With Me"), but leaked track "AtTENTion" is a bit darker: "My existence is militant." M.I.A. has said on Twitter that there are "no collabs" on this album, although she worked with producers Hit-Boy and So Japan, whose Kyle Edwards told MTV the album has "a lot more bounce to it."

Beyonce, "Mrs. Carter," summer TBA

Queen B has treated us to a few tracks so far from her fifth studio album -- "Grown Woman," "Standing on the Sun," "Bow Down/I Been On" -- so we know she's working on it. The only question is how much remains to be done before release, since she's currently on tour. Speaking of which ...

FESTIVALS

Sure, most of your favorite artists are on tour this summer -- from Beyonce to Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake to Taylor Swift -- but you'll get more bang for your buck if you check out one of the many music festivals around the country. You might even discover a new fave artist while you're there:

West Coast

If you're on the West Cost (or thereabouts), you might want to go to Bumbershoot in Seattle August 31-September 2 (Labor Day weekend). The lineup at Bumbershoot includes fun., Death Cab for Cutie, MGMT, Bob Mould, The Breeders, Matt & Kim and Heart. Death Cab for Cutie plans to play the 2003 album "Transatlanticism" in its entirety. (You know, the one from which Seth had the poster on his wall in "The O.C.") Also, the Experience Music Project will host an electronic dance music stage.

Those farther south on the coast might want to hit up Outside Lands in San Francisco August 9-11 which will include Red Hot Chili Peppers, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Vampire Weekend and Willie Nelson.

Midwest

If you're in the Midwest (or thereabouts), Lollapalooza in Chicago's Grant Park should be your destination August 2-4. The lineup includes Phoenix, Lana Del Rey, Queens of the Stone Age, The Cure, The Killers, The National, The Postal Service, Nine Inch Nails, Grizzly Bear and Ellie Goulding, plus plenty more. Granted, it's not the same as when Lollapalooza actually toured the country, but this is great for one-stop shopping to fulfill your summer music needs.

Also in the Midwest, Kanrockas in Kansas City, Kansas, June 28-29 -- with Kendrick Lamar, Passion Pit, Pretty Lights, Tiesto and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

East Coast

Folks on the East Coast should try their luck at the Governor's Ball in New York June 7-9, which Kanye West is headlining (Guns N' Roses are slated to make an appearance, but you never know with Axl Rose). Also on the bill are the Lumineers, Kendrick Lamar and Kings of Leon.

A little farther away from the Big Apple is the sure-to-be-eventful Hot 97 Summer Jam on June 2 in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which includes more Kendrick Lamar, plus A$AP Rocky, Wu-Tang Clan, Fabolous, Wale and Miguel.

The Firefly Music Festival in Dover, Delaware, June 21-23 offers the Alabama Shakes, Tom Petty, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Vampire Weekend, while the Budweiser Made in America fest in Philadelphia August 31-September 1 has Beyonce leading a lineup curated by her hubby Jay-Z: Public Enemy, Phoenix, Emeli Sande, Deadmau5, Wiz Khalifa, Nine Inch Nails, Queens of the Stone Age and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. (If Hova's doc "Jay-Z: Made in America" is released first, watch it to get amped).

The South

Down South, big festivals await. Bonnaroo in Manchester, Tennessee, June 13-16 has an eclectic lineup this year, with seasoned vets (Paul McCartney, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, David Byrne) facing off against typical festival fare (Mumford & Sons, Wilco, The Lumineers) and some beyond the norm choices (BjÃ¶rk, R. Kelly, Wu-Tang Clan). And then there's the comedy lineup, featuring David Cross (in case you didn't get enough of him in the new season of "Arrested Development"), Ed Helms (ditto for "The Hangover III"), and Bob Saget, who will probably work blue.

Meanwhile, the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans July 4 weekend will cool off with Jill Scott, Keyshia Cole, LL Cool J, Maxwell, Brandy and who else -- Beyonce.

Does that mean we'll have to wait a little longer for her new album? We've got all summer.
Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, suspected of leaking classified information to the WikiLeaks website, is being moved to the Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, defense officials said Tuesday.

"At this juncture of the case, given the likely continued period of pre-trial confinement, we have determined that the new pre-trial facility at Fort Leavenworth is the most appropriate one for Private Manning going forward," Defense Department General Counsel Jeh Johnson told reporters.

A defense official initially told CNN Manning was moving to the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, but later corrected that information.

Manning, 23, a military intelligence analyst from Oklahoma, was being held in the brig at Quantico Marine Base south of Washington. There had been a push by friends and supporters to have his confinement conditions eased. Supporters said he was confined in a one-man cell with only one hour a day outside of the cell for exercise.

Defense officials said at a briefing that an evaluation aimed at determining whether Manning is competent has been completed, and there was no need for him to remain in the Washington area.

Among those arrested at a demonstration protesting Manning's conditions last month were Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971 to the New York Times and retired U.S. Army Col. Ann Wright who resigned to protest the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

Johnson told reporters that the decision to move Manning is not meant as a criticism of the Quantico facility and congratulated the military personnel there for the job they did "in difficult circumstances."

"We remain satisfied that Private Manning's pre-trial confinement at Quantico was in compliance with legal and regulatory standards in all respects," he said.

Manning's case -- and the details of his detention -- drew attention last month in the aftermath of comments by former State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley and Crowley's sudden resignation.

Amidst reports that Manning had been forced to sleep without clothing and was confined to his cell 23 hours a day, Crowley had criticized how Manning was held at Quantico, calling it "ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid," according to news reports. He later stepped down from his post.

The Pentagon has maintained that Manning is held in accordance with rules governing all maximum-custody detainees at Quantico, for his protection and the safety of others, and that Manning is on "POI" status, for "prevention of injury."

Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, released a statement Tuesday after news of Manning's pending transfer broke, promising to demand written assurances from Defense Department officials that Manning's rights will be protected.

"Any move of Pfc. Manning does not change the underlying fact, which has not been disputed by the Department of Defense, that he has been held under conditions which may in fact constitute 'cruel and unusual punishment' in violation of the 8th amendment," he wrote.

U.S. military officials have told CNN that Manning is the prime suspect in the leak of hundreds of thousands of classified documents that ended up on the WikiLeaks website. He is awaiting a decision on whether he will face a court martial.

Last month, the Army notified Manning that he faces 22 more charges in connection with the alleged downloading of secret information from computers in Iraq, bringing to 34 the total charges in the case. The most serious new charge alleges he aided the enemy by making the information public; that charge is punishable by death.

A statement from the Army said the prosecution team "has notified the defense that the prosecution will not recommend the death penalty," but technically it is up to the commander overseeing the case to make the final decision.
(CNN) -- Pamela Anderson is set to bring a little Hollywood glamor to motorsport after becoming part owner of a sports car racing team.

The former Baywatch star has linked up with the Race Alliance team, which is competing in the inaugural FIA GT Series.

The Playboy pin-up ventured into motorsport in March 2012 when her and occasional racing driver Markus Fux fronted the Downforce1 European Le Mans teams.

Following the failure of that venture Fux and Anderson have teamed up with the Race Alliance team for the final three races of the GT Series' 2013 season.

"We want to make Race Alliance a recognizable name and have looked for the best drivers possible," a spokesman for the team told Autosport.com.

"The plan is to contest the full FIA GT Series next year, as well as the Nurburgring 24 Hours, and then look to NASCAR after that."

In Vitantonio Liuzzi and Mathias Lauda the Austrian team boasts two drivers of considerable pedigree.

F1 Inforgraphic: Deals on wheels

Liuzzi spent six years in Formula One, including one season with Red Bull, while his teammate Lauda is the son of Austria's triple F1 world champion Niki Lauda.

Liuzzi and Lauda will be behind the wheel of a Ferrari 458 Italia when the team debuts in Slovakia this weekend.

Three dates remain on the GT Series' 2013 calendar, with Spain and Azerbaijan hosting races after Slovakia.

Competing against Anderson's team will be one led by rally driving legend Sebastian Loeb.

The Frenchman won a record nine World Rally Championships in a row between 2004 and 2012 and now heads the Sebastian Loeb Racing team.
Young children are far more likely to experience attention and hyperactivity problems if their mother develops diabetes during pregnancy and they are born into a poor or lower-middle-class household, a new study suggests.

The study, published this week in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, found that children whose mothers received a diabetes diagnosis during pregnancy (known as gestational diabetes) were twice as likely as their peers to meet the criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at age six.

Living in a family with below-average socioeconomic status likewise doubled the risk of ADHD in six-year-olds. But children with both risk factors -- those who were exposed to gestational diabetes and grew up in a less-than-affluent household -- had a 14-fold increased risk of ADHD compared to children with neither risk factor.

Health.com: What causes ADHD? 12 myths and facts

The findings don't prove that gestational diabetes directly causes ADHD, but the researchers say they send a message to mothers and doctors that gestational diabetes may pose hidden dangers to a child well after birth, especially if the child grows up in a challenging environment.

"Mothers should be aware that gestational diabetes can affect her fetus," says Yoko Nomura, Ph.D., the lead author of the study and an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City.

Gestational diabetes, which affects roughly 5% of expectant mothers in the United States, generally develops during the second or third trimester of pregnancy -- the same window of time in which a fetus undergoes a critical burst of brain development.

Health.com: Tips for a healthy pregnancy with diabetes

Women with gestational diabetes have abnormally high blood sugar (glucose). If the fetus is bombarded with excess blood sugar, energy normally used for nervous-system development could potentially be diverted to absorb that excess, Nomura says. As a result, the central nervous system may not develop properly.

Growing up in poverty would likely aggravate any underlying nervous-system deficits, Nomura says.

"When babies are born into higher socioeconomic status households, they have better access to medical care [and] remedial activities, intellectual stimulus is higher, they have better foods," she says.

In addition, low-income women may not control their gestational diabetes as well as more prosperous mothers-to-be, says Luigi Garibaldi, M.D., clinical director of pediatric endocrinology at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

"Having diabetes during pregnancy by itself may not be so bad, but if you don't take care of it, there may be consequences on the brain development of the child," says Garibaldi, who was not involved in the study.

Nomura and her colleagues followed 212 ethnically and socioeconomically diverse children living in Queens, New York, 10% of whom were exposed to gestational diabetes. From preschool through age six, a trained psychologist or doctoral student evaluated each child for ADHD symptoms annually.

The study had several shortcomings. It was relatively small, and although they did take into account the parents' history of ADHD, the researchers didn't collect data on whether the children had siblings or other relatives with attention or hyperactivity problems. Also, Garibaldi notes, the researchers didn't measure how well the mothers controlled their gestational diabetes.

Still, the study is a valuable reminder that a child's environment -- in and out of the womb -- appears to affect the risk of ADHD, says Joel Nigg, Ph.D., a professor of psychiatry at Oregon Health & Science University, in Portland.

Health.com: ADHD linked to pesticide exposure

Previous research suggests, for instance, that children are at increased risk of ADHD if they're exposed to lead and certain pesticides.

"As a precaution, we might want to add [gestational diabetes] to the list of risk factors we're aware of," says Nigg, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.

NASA ANNOUNCER: Two....one...booster ignition...and the final liftoff of Discovery.

CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Of course, we will have more on that for you in today's show, but we are getting off the ground in northern Africa. My name is Carl Azuz. CNN Student News starts right now!

First Up: Unrest in Libya

AZUZ: There are roughly 6,000 Americans in Libya, and the U.S. government is trying to get them out. A ferry that was chartered to take hundreds of U.S. citizens from Libya to Malta was held up for a while yesterday. U.S. officials said everyone onboard was safe. They said the delay was because of the weather.

Meanwhile, Libya's leader, Moammar Gadhafi, is blaming the violence in his country on young people. He says they're taking some sort of pills and being manipulated by the al Qaeda terrorist group. But during a speech earlier this week, President Obama said what's going on in that part of the world has nothing to do with outside influences.

U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: So let me be clear. The change that is taking place across the region is being driven by the people of the region. This change doesn't represent the work of the United States or any foreign power. It represents the aspirations of people who are seeking a better life.

Political Unrest

AZUZ: Looking around that region, starting next door to Libya in Algeria. The country has lifted a 19-year-old state of emergency, and what that means is that people there have greater freedom of speech and assembly now. Moving south to Cameroon, where protesters are demanding that the country's president step down. He's been in power for nearly 30 years and is running for re-election this year. Finally, Yemen, where eight lawmakers resigned to protest violence against people who are demonstrating against the government. One of the lawmakers said, "I resigned because there's been no respect by the government for human rights."

Is This Legit?

JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The space shuttle Discovery is named after sailing ships. This one's true! The shuttle is named after two ships that explored the world.

Final Mission

AZUZ: The space shuttle Discovery has made more trips into space than any other craft. All together, the shuttle's spent almost a full year in orbit around the Earth. Yesterday, Discovery set out on its 39th and last mission, delivering equipment to the international space station. This was Discovery's first launch, back in 1984. And these launches aren't cheap. NASA estimates that every time a shuttle takes off, it costs nearly half a billion dollars. After Discovery's current mission, there are just two launches left for the space shuttle program.

Budget Battle

AZUZ: We've been reporting on this controversial budget bill in Wisconsin. You can check our transcript archives for details on that. Now, it was scheduled to come up for a vote yesterday, but only in the State House of Representatives. Things are not moving forward in the Wisconsin Senate. And that's because Democratic senators have left the state in an effort to try to block any vote on the bill. You can get the latest details on this situation at CNN.com.

Shoutout

TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Bozic's world geography class at Cypress Creek High School in Houston, Texas! Willie O'Ree was the first African-American to play in what sports league? Was it the: A) MLB, B) NBA, C) NFL or D) NHL? You've got three seconds -- GO! Willie O'Ree made his debut in the National Hockey League in 1958. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout!

Diversity in Hockey

AZUZ: Willie O'Ree paved the way for other African-Americans to hit the NHL ice. As we continue our commemoration of Black History Month, we're taking a look at the diversity on the Atlanta Thrashers' roster. Richelle Carey sat down with the team's four African-Americans to talk about life as a minority pro hockey player.

(BEGIN VIDEO)

RICHELLE CAREY, HLN ANCHOR: I want each one of you to tell me what you like about hockey. Sell me on hockey! Sell me!

EVANDER KANE, THRASHERS LEFT WINGER: Hockey is the fastest, most physical sport there is.

JOHNNY ODUYA, THRASHERS DEFENSEMAN: The teamwork, too. I would say a total package sport.

ANTHONY STEWART, THRASHERS RIGHT WINGER: I just like skating fast, ever since I was three.

DUSTIN BYFUGLIEN, THRASHERS DEFENSEMAN: I guess it's just something about being on the ice that I enjoy. It's just me being out there, having fun and enjoying the people around me.

CAREY: What's the biggest misconception or false assumption that people make about you?

BYFUGLIEN: This guy can't stand on skates.

ODUYA: Maybe in Atlanta, you tell people that you're a hockey player and they don't believe you.

CAREY: What do you think?

ODUYA: I don't know. Maybe basketball or baseball, I have no idea.

CAREY: Who here knew that they were going to be a professional hockey player? Anybody here know that?

STEWART: I knew probably when I was in grade one. We had an assignment to say what you wanted to be when you grew up. And I said, "Hockey player," and she said, "Pick something else." And I said, "No, I'm going to be a hockey player," and I stuck with it.

CAREY: Did anybody try to steer you to something different, because you don't look out on the ice that often and see people of color? Did someone say this isn't the right fit for you?

KANE: No, I think, honestly, it was almost the opposite. My dad really instilled that drive in me to battle through that kind of stuff, battle through adversity, and that's what made me so successful.

CAREY: Anybody else feel that they were steered in a different direction for racial reasons at all?

STEWART: I grew up sort of in an urban neighborhood and, you know, a lot of my friends are playing basketball and sports like that. I'd go play a little bit of basketball, but after an hour I'd get bored of it, so I'd say, "I have to go play hockey now." And they would go, "Uh, naw, you're not going to make it in hockey, so you might as well play basketball" or something like that. But I had some support from my parents. That helped me a lot. All my close friends to date were minor hockey players, and their support helped get me to where I am today.

CAREY: We always hear about hockey as, it's an expensive sport for kids who want to play. And often, maybe, that's why minority kids don't get into it. Explain, why is it so expensive?

STEWART: I think when you have to pay $500 for a pair of skates as opposed to a $20 basketball or $50 pair of soccer shoes, it makes a lot more sense to play those sports. But there's a lot of community initiatives right now in the NHL helping urban kids. And with the Hockey Is For Everyone program that's helping not so fortunate kids play, they're making good strides.

London (CNN) -- India has launched a rocket it hopes will allow it to join an elite group of space explorers to Mars.

The country's space research organization (ISRO) launched its orbiter to the Red Planet on Tuesday -- only NASA, the former Soviet Union and the Europeans have previously been successful in operating probes from Mars.

Japan made an attempt with the Nozomi orbiter in 1998 but it failed to reach the planet and a Chinese probe was lost along with the Russian Phobos-Grunt mission in January 2012. The UK's Beagle 2 probe separated from the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter in 2003 but nothing was ever heard from the lander.

It will take 10 months for India's Mars Orbiter Mission to reach the Red Planet after lifting off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre near Chennai. The probe will explore the planet's surface features, minerals and atmosphere.

ISRO is hoping to discover more about the loss of water from Mars, map the sources of methane gas, as well as collecting data about the two moons Phobos and Deimos.

But ISRO chairman K Radhakrishnan told CNN that one of the biggest technological challenges was just getting there. Many missions have failed to reach the planet while others have crashed on the surface or contact has been lost before the probes could send back data.

India's space program launched its first Earth satellite in 1975 and put an unmanned probe into orbit around the Moon in 2008. It plans to launch its own manned spaceflight in 2016, though an Indian cosmonaut, Rakesh Sharma, flew aboard a Soviet space mission in 1984.

The U.S. is aiming to build on the success of a series of robots that have roamed the surface of the Red Planet when it launches its own orbiter mission called Maven -- Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft -- scheduled to launch on November 18.

The European Space Agency is working with the Russians on an ExoMars rover that is due to start its mission in 2018.

But private companies are also proposing trips to the Red Planet -- and some of them are only one-way.

The Mars One project wants to colonize Earth's neighbor, beginning in 2022 and the Inspire Mars Foundation wants to launch a man and a woman on a 501-day round-trip in 2018 without ever touching down.

Japan's deputy prime minister stirred controversy this week by appearing to suggest that the government could learn from the way that Nazi Germany changed its constitution.

The remarks by Taro Aso, who is also the Japanese finance minister, provoked criticism from Japan's neighbors and a Jewish organization in the United States.

Aso, a former prime minister who has slipped up with verbal gaffes in the past, retracted the comments later in the week but refused to apologize for them or resign, saying they had been taken out of context.

Amid persistent talk in Japan about revising the country's pacifist post-war constitution, Aso set off the controversy at a seminar Monday, in which he said that discussions over constitutional changes should be carried out calmly.

"Germany's Weimar Constitution was changed into the Nazi Constitution before anyone knew," he said in comments widely reported by the Japanese media. "It was changed before anyone else noticed. Why don't we learn from that method?"

Aso added: "I have no intention of denying democracy. Again, I repeat that we should not decide [constitutional revisions] in a frenzy."

In 1933, Adolf Hitler's National Socialists turned the democratic Weimar Republic into a dictatorship using "a combination of legal procedure, persuasion, and terror," according to the U.S. Library of Congress.

Hitler used a fire that burned down the parliament building as a pretext to suppress the opposition through an emergency clause in the constitution. He then pushed through the Enabling Act, which allowed him to govern without parliament and vastly extend the Nazis' grip on power.

Words that hurt

Aso's apparent reference to those changes drew expressions of concern from the governments of China and South Korea, two countries that suffered heavily under Japanese imperial aggression during World War II, a conflict in which Japan was allied with Nazi Germany.

Beijing and Seoul are already wary of Japan's hawkish prime minister, Shinzo Abe. His campaign platform for elections last year included measures aimed at restoring Japanese national pride such as revising the constitution to give the country's self-defense forces the status of a regular army.

Abe's party now has control of both houses of parliament. But it remains unclear if he will take on the difficult, controversial challenge of constitutional change, which would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers.

Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said Wednesday that Aso's comments mean that other countries need to step up their vigilance over the direction in which Japan is headed.

China and Japan are locked in a tense territorial dispute over a set of small, uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that has fueled nationalist sentiments in on both sides.

South Korea, meanwhile, called for "prudence" from Japanese political leaders.

"Such comments definitely hurt a lot of people," Cho Tai-young, a foreign ministry spokesman, said Tuesday.

And the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization based in Los Angeles, demanded that Aso immediately clarify his remarks.

"What 'techniques' from the Nazis' governance are worth learning — how to stealthily cripple democracy?" asked Rabbi Abraham Cooper, an associate dean at the center.

"The only lessons on governance that the world should draw from the Nazi Third Reich is how those in positions of power should not behave," Cooper said in a statement Tuesday.

'Great misunderstandings'

Aso responded Thursday to the criticism over his comments, which also came from opposition lawmakers in Japan, saying he regretted that the remarks had "caused great misunderstandings despite my true intentions."

He said that he had referred to the Nazi takeover of power as a "bad example" of constitutional revision because changes were forced through "in a commotion."  They should be done through calm debates instead.

"I believe it is obvious that I feel extremely negatively about Nazi Germany, if you consider the entire context," he said. "However, since these remarks have caused serious misunderstandings, I would like to retract them."

Japanese Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference the same day that "the Abe administration definitely does not view Nazi Germany positively and I am sure Vice Prime Minister Aso himself does not either."

It's not the first time Aso's words have gotten him into hot water. At a meeting about social security reform and healthcare costs in January, he caused offense by suggesting it would be best for people on life support to "die quickly."

"Aso's comment about Hitler and the implication that his example should be followed are utterly unacceptable," the Asahi Shimbun, a daily newspaper, said in an editorial Friday. " The remark is not something that Aso can get away with by simply retracting it."
The shoe attack on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Egypt, the latest on a politician in the Middle East, causes many in West to ask: Why is throwing a shoe such a big deal?

One of CNN's resident experts is producer Mohammed Tawfeeq, who was in Baghdad when President George W. Bush dodged a flying shoe at news conference in the U.S. Embassy in December 2008.

Journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi tossed it because he wanted to "humiliate the tyrant," his brother told CNN.

"Yes, I was there," Tawfeeq said. "It was a very big deal in Iraq."

In fact, some Iraqis celebrated that moment, he said.

"Other people were not happy because for them they see it -- by end of the day -- like a guest visiting their country," Tawfeeq said.  "Traditionally, it was also offensive to insult a guest."

The act of throwing a shoe at someone or showing them your sole is "incredibly offensive" in the Middle East, he said.

"The bottom line is a shoe is dirt," he said. "Throwing a shoe on someone means throwing dirt on that person."

Professor Faegheh Shirazi, with Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Texas, agreed, saying it is offensive "regardless of the religious practices."

"Throwing a shoe or hitting someone with a shoe or showing the bottom of your shoe when sitting with legs up on a chair and facing another person all are culturally unacceptable and are considered to be a grave insult and belittling to a person," Shirazi said.

Another offensive aspect is the significance of the shoe being a sign of wealth.

"Most often, lower-status people and poor men could not wear shoes," Shirazi said. "The feet came in contact with pollution and the dirt on the road. The dirt on the feet indicated the lack of social status, the level of economic class and the level of education and lack of sophistication and intellect."

Tawfeeq, who occasionally visits the United States, was surprised to learn shoe throwing was not considered an offense in North America.

A search of literature reveals references suggesting the power of the shoe is ancient.

For example, in the King James Version of the Old Testament, Psalm 60:8 says: "Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me."

"Perhaps it has to do with the hierarchy of the body position, that is, the relationship between the head and the feet, the head being at the top and not touching the ground and the dirt," Shirazi said.  "The head carries a more prestigious status in comparison to the feet, which in older times mostly remained bare."
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- The children keep asking when their mother is coming home.

Lee Khim Fatt doesn't know what to tell them.

It's been more than three weeks since his wife, a flight attendant on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, disappeared along with 238 others when the jet vanished mid-flight.

"I told them mummy's going to take a bit longer to come home this time, and I even promised them I'm going to bring her home," Lee says.

His eyes fill with tears as he explains his plight. It's a promise he's not sure he can keep.

"I really don't know where she is now," he says, "and now I am not sure whether I could bring her home."

Lee and his wife, Foong Wai Yueng, shared a happy life together, raising their 10-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son.

They met 20 years ago when she was just 19. He was her first boyfriend. Without her, Lee says he's lost his direction.

An 18-year Malaysia Airlines veteran, she loved to fly around the world.

The destinations were different, he says, but her returns home were always the same.

"Every time she came back, definitely she got something for the kids," he says. "This is what she loved to do."

Quest for answers

Dozens of anguished relatives Sunday demanded that Malaysian authorities provide them with evidence of the fate of their loved ones aboard the missing Boeing 777.

"We want evidence, we want truth and we want our family," they chanted at a news conference outside a Kuala Lumpur hotel.

While many of the passengers' families are staying together in hotels, Lee remains at his home waiting for information about the missing flight.

On Sunday, the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 turned up fresh potential clues as an Australian aircraft spotted four orange objects in the water. But investigators haven't yet confirmed whether the objects were from the airliner, which officials believe went down in the southern Indian Ocean.

Lee said he hears from Malaysia Airlines just once or twice a day, by phone or text message.

He's angry at how the airline has handled the ordeal. Even though his wife was part of the cabin crew, he says he gets more information from the media than the airline. He watches the near-daily press conferences on television.

"The airline management only call us or have some briefing with us, you know, and then they tell us the same thing again as what the press conference told," he complained.

His frustration has led in part to his decision to hire a Chicago-based law firm. They've filed a petition on his behalf, seeking records from Boeing and Malaysia Airlines.

Amid the confusion, Malaysia said it has done its best with what it has.

"History will judge us as a country that has been very responsible," Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia's acting transportation minister, said.

The waiting for the families has not been easy. Lee wants the truth about what happened to MH370. He wants something to tell his daughter, when she asks what happened to her mother. Most of all he wants his wife to come home.

"Of course I'm still hoping for god's miracles," he says.

Families turn grief into action

(CNN)Combining healthy eating with moral support, Jean Nidetch became a heavyweight in the weight-loss industry. The founder of Weight Watchers died Wednesday at her home in Florida.

She was 91.

What would become Weight Watchers started as a group of friends meeting in her Queens, New York, living room in 1961.

Nidetch described herself as an "overweight housewife obsessed with cookies."

After countless fad diets, Nidetch figured that accountability was the key to keeping the weight off.  At the time, she was 38 years old and weighed more than 200 pounds.

Her guiding philosophy: "It's choice -- not chance -- that determines your destiny."

Through the program of regular weigh-ins, peer support and accountability, not only did Nidetch lose 72 pounds, but she inspired millions more to shed pounds too.

She officially launched Weight Watchers in 1963 and took the company public five years later.

"Jean was an inspiration and an innovator who leaves behind a legacy and program that has positively impacted the health and well-being of millions of people around the world," said Jim Chambers, president and CEO Weight Watchers International. "It is our honor and responsibility to carry on her legacy to help more people to transform their lives."
(CNN) -- When Marita Cheng was told to clean her room as a child, she imagined an army of robots doing the dirty work for her.

"I looked around and I didn't see any robots helping me with the household chores," the 24-year-old engineering whiz said. "And I thought: 'I want to be part of making robots a reality.'"

Speaking to Cheng, one of Australia's brightest young scientists, you get the feeling there's not much she couldn't solve with a bit of brain power.

Her latest project? Creating a bionic arm that could revolutionize the lives of quadriplegics around the world.

Young gun

Watching Cheng speaking to a packed Sydney Opera House crowd at one of her TEDx talks, it's hard not to get swept up in her effervescent and eloquent "can-do" view of the world.

"Why are we as a country doing such a bad job at inspiring the next generation of engineers?" she asks, microphone headpiece strapped on, before clicking to her next slide show on a giant screen behind.

Has she always been this confident?

"I don't know, I guess I get scared all the time really," she says, speaking by phone above the din of Melbourne trams trundling past.

Robogals

In 2012, Cheng was named "Young Australian of the Year," a hugely prestigious award that saw her join the ranks of other remarkable youngsters Jessica Watson, the youngest person to single-handedly sail around the world, and swimmer Ian Thorpe, the country's most successful Olympian.

Cheng quickly learned to become comfortable on stage, in the following year giving 150 lectures on her work that combined science and, rather unusually, feminism.

While an engineering student at Melbourne University -- one of just five women in a class of over 50 men -- Cheng founded Robogals, a group of students encouraging girls to get involved in science and technology.

Just 11% of engineers in Australia are women -- it's a similar story the U.S. (14%) and Britain (9%) --and Cheng felt compelled to show a new generation of girls that science could be fulfilling and even, wait for it, cool.

"There's this perception that engineering is for men, and girls don't do that," she said.

"When I go to expos for Robogals, I get young girls come up to me and say: 'Oh my brother might be interested in this.' But I'm like: 'No, this is something you can do, it's really fun.' They don't even realize it's a possibility before you tell them that it is."

Within four years, the organization had expanded to Britain, the U.S., and Japan, teaching over 8,000 girls robotics through school workshops, career talks, and community events.

Out on a limb

When Cheng recently graduated with a degree in Mechatronics and Computer Science, she had the choice of hundreds of job offers.

Instead, she decided to strike out on her own, founding 2Mar Robotics -- a company "focused on building beautiful robots that help us in our everyday lives."

The team is now working on a bionic arm -- called "Jeva" -- which would help quadriplegics. Mounted on a wheelchair, the high-tech limb would be voice-operated and able to remember and repeat common tasks.

"I was still finishing my studies off and I thought: 'What do I want to do? What's a cool, fun thing to do? What will make me feel fulfilled? What will give me purpose in my life?'" said Cheng.

The lucky country

Growing up in a social housing estate in tropical north Queensland, the determined young woman says her mom, a single-parent and hotel cleaner, was a huge influence in her life.

"She always just did what she had to do, and that's what I saw as a kid."

Does she think Australians are too laid back when it comes to technology?

"I think we could have more of a vision for the future," she says. "Otherwise, if you're just focused on the past, then there'll be other countries that are more hungry, more innovative, and doing their best to work towards a better future."

"One day we'll wake up and say: 'OK, what happened to all the great stuff that we enjoy?'"
(CNN) -- Standing in the shadow of the Burj Dubai Kye Ho Kim of Samsung Construction rattles off the list of records the building will break.

Standing about a half mile high, it will be the world's tallest building, with the most floors (164) and the world's highest and fastest building. "This building is going to break so many records," said Kim, whose company is building the $4 billion tower, scheduled to open later this year. "This is kind of a project like the first exploration of the moon. Nobody can challenge it."

It may not rank with manned missions to the moon, but right now there is nothing else like the Burj Dubai on Earth. As the project is metaphoric for the strength of Samsung Construction, the company itself symbolizes the growth of South Korea onto the world stage. A country once devastated by war and still divided by north and south has rebuilt itself into a modern capitalist democracy with companies with a global reach such as Samsung

Samsung has cornered the market in giant building construction, building the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur and Taipei 101 in Taiwan -- both previous world-record holders.

"Think about the Americans when they constructed the Empire State Building in 1931," Kim said. "So have we ... in a very short period of time we are now the leading company in the world."

Some of Korea's more impressive building projects are happening at home. In the midst of the recession, construction of Songdo -- a 1,500-acre new free trade zone built on reclaimed land two hours out of Seoul -- continues apace, with a projected cost of $35 billion. Developers hope it will be the eventual home of 75,000 people.

It's considered one of the world's largest private real estate development ventures in history, a joint project with South Korea's Posco and Gale International, a U.S. real estate developer. "Under construction today is about $10 billion" of the project, said Chris Sausser, executive vice president of Gale International. "The project we're building has been able to attract multinational companies, investors as well as residents."

Postwar South Korea was based on a "growth at any cost" model, but the South Korean government has pledged 2 percent of its GDP for the next five years dedicated to green development. The country, already the world's most wired, plans to develop next-generation Internet connections that use less computing power. Indoor lighting initiatives are replacing traditional bulbs with lower energy LED lights.

"Green growth is not a plan B, it is plan A," said Kim Sang Hyup, executive director of the Green Growth Committee. "We are going to contribute to the global community by action, not talk."

(CNN) -- A 65-year-old man flying from California to Hawaii was forced to ditch his plane in the Pacific Ocean on Friday night 13 miles off the coast of Hilo after running out of gas, the U.S. Coast Guard said.

The man was flying for delivery a Cessna 310 twin-engine aircraft from Monterey, California, to Hilo when he radioed federal aviation authorities that he was 500 miles out and low on fuel, said Petty Officer 3rd Class Angela Henderson, a spokeswoman for the Coast Guard.

He estimated he would run out of fuel 100 miles short of the island, according to a Coast Guard statement.

The Coast Guard deployed rescue crews aboard a C-130 Hercules and an MH-65 Dolphin helicopter to intercept the pilot and escort his plane with the hope of coaching him to a safe landing, said Coast Guard Lt. Gene Maestas. A Coast Guard ship was also at the scene.

The plane didn't make it, running out of fuel as the pilot had predicted.

"The pilot ditched his airplane at approximately 5:23 p.m. and climbed out of the cockpit onto the wing," the Coast Guard said in a statement.

Video released Saturday by the Coast Guard shows the small aircraft skimming along the water before coming to a stop. It eventually settles and floats in the water, seemingly intact and with its nose pointed in the opposite direction from which it came.

A man is then shown being pulled from the water toward the helicopter.

After being rescued, the pilot was transported to Hilo Medical Center for evaluation, Henderson said.

"He was reported to be coherent with no significant injuries," the statement said.

American King Air Services, an airplane ferry service, said on its website Saturday that the pilot had "successfully ditched." It said that he is "in good condition," and that the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident.

The plane was registered to the Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, company. Neither American King Air nor the Coast Guard immediately released the pilot's identity.

"We are waiting right now to hear from the Coast Guard about the aircraft," Pablo Bassabe, a company vice president, told CNN.

Hilo is about 2,300 miles west of Monterey, where the pilot's flight began.

According to the aviation site Airliners.net, Cessna 310 aircraft have a range between 760 to 1955 miles, depending on various factors including cruising altitude, weight, amount of reserve fuel and the specific model.
(CNN) -- Egypt's revolution has made life tougher still for Cairo's 80,000 taxi drivers, struggling to make a living on the city's chaotic, congested and potholed streets, says the author who has written a best-selling book about them.

Khaled AlKhamissi's novel "Taxi," first published in 2006, has been translated into 10 languages. It features 58 fictional monologues with taxi drivers recreated from his own experience. A new post-revolution English edition has just been published.

Despite the optimism that swept Egypt after president Hosni Mubarak was toppled in February, AlKhamissi said taxi drivers, and the rest of the country's poor, have in fact suffered more since then.

"My taxi drivers are among the 55% of the population living under the poverty line of $2 a day," said AlKhamissi. "Those 55% were not on the streets during the revolution and are without a real voice now.

"They are wise, they are watching, they are analyzing, but they are not acting."

He added: "Life has changed for them in the wrong direction. It's worse for them because we have no security and living on the streets without security is dangerous.

"There is less tourism and more chaos on the streets."

AlKhamissi said it was too early to tell if life was improving for the middle classes who took to the streets during the revolution.

"We are in the middle of a battle, and during the battle we can't see whether life is improving or not," he said.

AlKhamissi, whose second novel "Noah's Ark" -- also a bestseller -- was published in 2009, said he stopped writing his third novel at the start of the uprising on January 25 this year and has been unable to concentrate on writing since.

"It's impossible to write because my mind is taken with what is happening day after day, hour after hour," he said.

Since January, AlKhamissi has filled his time with a weekly newspaper column, lectures and speaking events. But the author wants to get back to writing fiction.

"Every night I want to write because it is my only job, my only happiness," he said. "I have to find a solution soon or I will die."

"Taxi" was credited with single-handedly reviving an interest in reading in Egypt, according to its publisher Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation, but AlKhamissi denies his book is responsible.

He said: "Some journalists have said that about my book, but it's nonsense to say that one book or 10 books can change reading habits.

"Reading has increased in the last six years, but it has taken many social factors. We have had a cultural revolution in the last six years in all matters: Theater, music, fiction and publishing.

"This cultural revolution is related to youth searching for a dream."

AlKhamissi said he dreams of an Egypt where taxi drivers could have the time and education to read his -- or any other -- book.

"They don't have time to read because they are struggling to survive," he said. "When we can increase the quality of education and decrease poverty, then they will be able to read. I'm not interested in whether they read my book, I just hope they will read anything."

Another novelist credited with changing reading habits in Egypt is Ahmed Khaled Towfik, a 49-year-old medical professor described by Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation as the Arab world's most prominent bestselling author of fantasy and horror. He has written more than 200 books, selling millions of copies.

He said he was among the first Egyptian authors to write for young people.

"Twenty years ago there was nothing for 16, 17, 18-year-olds to read," said Towfik. "We invented popular literature. I think I made the youth fond of reading.

"I think most of my readers were in Tahrir Square. I changed a part of their thinking, although you can't compare that to their economic disappointment or the scourge of the police system."

Towfik's book "Utopia," which has just been published in English, is a grim futuristic account of Egyptian society in the year 2023 with wealthy gated communities insulated from the poverty outside.

Towfik said that despite Egypt's revolution, he still fears the scenes in his book, first published in Arabic in 2009, could come true.

"The first uprising came from the middle class, but I think another bloodier one could come from the lower classes, like described in my book 'Utopia'.

"I still think there's a danger my book could come true."

He added: "After nine months, nothing has been accomplished except getting rid of Mubarak. We got rid of the head of the snake, but the body of the snake is still ruling everything."
London (CNN) -- Peaches Geldof, the daughter of musician Bob Geldof and the late Paula Yates, died of a heroin overdose after relapsing into use of the illegal drug following attempts to give it up, an inquest heard Wednesday.

The death of the 25-year-old TV host in April at her home in Wrotham, Kent, southeast of London, shocked the entertainment world.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham of Kent police told the inquest that Geldof had been addicted to heroin for a number of years but had ceased taking the drug more recently.

Geldof, who had two children younger than 2, had been supported by drug treatment workers for 2Â½ years, being prescribed methadone, he said. She had said she wanted to come off methadone completely and was following a reduction plan.

A drug test in November indicated that she was not taking any illegal drugs, he said. However, in February, witnesses reported suspicions that she had started using heroin again.

High-grade heroin

Fotheringham's report to the inquest gave new details of Geldof's death.

Police who searched the house where she died found a black cloth bag hidden in a cupboard above the door of a spare bedroom, he said.

Inside was a bag containing what tests proved to be heroin as well as a bag of citric acid, used to make the heroin more soluble in water for injection, according to the report. The bag also held dozens of syringes, some sealed while others contained traces of a brown residue, alcohol wipes, cotton buds and cards advertising a needle exchange in central London.

According to a police drug expert, PC Adrian Parsons, the heroin found was of "importation quality" -- that is, with a purity of 61%, compared with the average 26% purity found at street level.

The 6.91 grams (about a quarter-ounce) recovered would have been worth Â£350 to Â£550 (about $600 to $940), Fotheringham said.

Burnt spoon, knotted tights

Geldof was discovered sitting slumped on a bed in the spare bedroom by her husband, rock musician Tom Cohen, who went to their home after he became concerned when he couldn't contact her.

The couple's younger son, Phaedra, was in the house at the time, having been dropped off by Cohen's father the previous afternoon. The musician had taken both children to spend the weekend at his parents' home.

A pair of knotted black tights was found under her body, and a burnt spoon containing a small amount of a brown residue in the bowl was found under the bed, Fotheringham said. The tights could have been used as a tourniquet while she was injecting the drug.

An autopsy also found evidence of recent puncture marks on the inside of both elbows and on her left hand.

The inquest heard that tests by a forensic scientist suggested recent use of the drug, resulting in a "high" concentration of heroin in Geldof's body, which was "at the end of the range of values at which fatalities have occurred."

She was not under the influence of alcohol at the time of her death, tests revealed. Nor had she taken a significant amount of any other substances in the hours leading up to her death.

Reduced tolerance?

The scientist's report notes that people using heroin regularly "develop a tolerance to the drug, and such individuals can use doses that would be toxic, or fatal, to people with no tolerance."

But it adds that tolerance "appears to be lost fairly rapidly when users cease to use the drug, and deaths commonly occur in people who have previously been tolerant and have returned to using heroin."

Fotheringham's report concluded, "There is no indication that any other third party was present or involved in her death and there is no indication that Peaches intended to take her own life or harm herself in any way as she was reported to be of happy disposition and planning for the future with friends and family."

Geldof was 11 years old when her mother died of a drug overdose.

Kent police continue to investigate who supplied the heroin to Geldof, but no arrests have been made.

(CNN) -- Organs donated by a slain Oakland, California, police officer saved four lives, and his donated tissue will enhance the lives of up to 50 others, the California Transplant Donor Network said Wednesday.

Officer John Hege was one of four police officers fatally shot Saturday in Oakland, California.

Officer John Hege, 41, was pronounced brain dead on Sunday but was kept on life support pending a decision on organ donation. He was the fourth Oakland officer to die after a gunman fired on police in two weekend incidents.

"Officer Hege was registered on the Donate Life California Organ and Tissue Registry, which his family also supports," the donor network said in a news release. "He chose in death as he did in life to help those in need. His organ donations saved the lives of four adult males from California."

Hege's liver, kidneys and heart were donated, the network said, and the transplants were successfully completed Tuesday and early Wednesday.

In a written statement, Hege's family said, "Our son John never met a stranger."

"John's courage and strength was enhanced by his ability to perceive the realities of life," the family said in the statement. "In June 2008, he registered on the Donate Life California Organ and Tissue Donor Registry. We completely and proudly support his decision, and it gives us a great deal of comfort to know that four individuals have received the gift of life because of our selfless and beloved John.

"Even in death he gave to the lives of those in our community whom he had always loved and supported."

Hege had been with the Oakland police force about 10 years.

The man accused of shooting the officers -- Lovelle Mixon, 26, of Oakland -- was fatally shot in a gun battle with SWAT officers in an apartment complex where he was hiding, police said. Authorities said Saturday night that Mixon had an extensive criminal history and was in violation of parole for assault with a deadly weapon.

The incidents began about 1 p.m. Saturday in east Oakland, when two motorcycle officers tried to pull over a car for a "fairly routine traffic stop," said Dave Kozicki, deputy police chief.

Emergency dispatchers received reports that two officers had been shot and needed help, he said. Those officers were Hege and Sgt. Mark Dunakin, 40, an 18-year veteran of the force. Dunakin died Saturday.

Police launched an intense manhunt to track down the gunman. An anonymous caller directed authorities to a building on an adjacent street where the man was believed to be barricaded, acting Police Chief Howard Jordan said.

The gunman fired on SWAT officers who entered the apartment, hitting two of them before police shot and killed the man, Jordan said. Those two officers -- Sgt. Ervin Romans, 43, and Sgt. Daniel Sakai, 35 -- died. Police said Romans had been with the department since 1996 and Sakai since 2000.

A fifth officer who was grazed by a bullet was treated at a hospital and released, police spokesman Jeff Thomason said Saturday.
(CNN) -- Polygamist sect leader Warren Steed Jeffs, who is awaiting trial in southern Utah, was charged with eight additional felony counts from Arizona in two separate cases, authorities said Thursday.

Polygamist Warren Jeffs is facing eight additional counts related to alleged incest and sexual contact with a minor.

A grand jury indicted Jeffs May 10 on two counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two counts of incest for alleged incidents that occurred in 2002, according to a statement issued by Mohave County Attorney Matthew J. Smith.

On Thursday, another grand jury indicted him on two additional counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two additional counts of incest. Those offenses took place in Colorado City, Arizona, in 2003, according to the indictment.

Both indictments state that Jeffs, leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS), committed the offenses "as an accomplice."

According to Arizona law, sexual conduct with a minor is a Class 6 felony punishable upon conviction by up to a year in prison. Incest is a class 4 felony punishable upon conviction by up to 2½ years in prison.

"The cases involve two separate victims," Smith said in the statement. "Mr. Jeffs will not come to Mohave County to face these charges or to have an initial appearance on them until his Utah case is resolved."

Jeffs, 51, is awaiting trial in Washington County, Utah, on a charge of being an accomplice to rape by arranging the marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old cousin.

The trial initially was set to begin in April, but Fifth District Judge James Shumate postponed it earlier this year, and a new date has not been set. At the time, Shumate said the delay was due to "recent information in the case," but he did not elaborate.

The judge in March refused a defense request to move the trial out of Washington County because of press coverage, but he said he may reconsider if attorneys encounter difficulty during jury selection.

Utah prosecutors say that because Jeffs forced the underage girl to marry, and therefore forced her to have sex with the adult man, and because Jeffs insisted she stay married, he is an accomplice to rape.

During his preliminary hearing in December, Jeffs' defense attorneys said that he never knew whether the marriage he arranged was consummated and, if it was, whether the sex was consensual.

The girl, identified only as Jane Doe, testified at the preliminary hearing that she was "so scared" during the forced wedding.

"The whole time I was crying," she said. "I wanted to die."

The rape as an accomplice charge is a first-degree felony in Utah, carrying a penalty upon conviction of five years to life in prison.

Jeffs previously was charged in Arizona with two counts of sexual conduct with a minor for allegedly presiding over arranged marriages, along with an additional charge of conspiracy.

Those charges, from 2005, were put on hold while Jeffs faces trial in Utah.

Jeffs was captured August 28, 2006, in a traffic stop near Las Vegas, Nevada. At the time, he had been on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List for months.

The FLDS freely practices polygamy in the towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, which straddle the state line. The sect maintains groups of followers in Texas, South Dakota, Nevada, British Columbia and Mexico.

The offshoot sect broke from the mainline Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, over the practice of polygamy.

The Mormon church, which gave up plural marriage more than a century ago, has no ties to Jeffs' group. E-mail to a friend
(CNN) -- The new year emerges from the depths of winter. In many countries bells ring out at midnight on New Year's Eve -- a sound that the writer Charles Lamb described nearly 200 years ago as the most regretful sound he ever heard, reminding him of everything he had suffered or neglected in the past 12 months.

More recently, though, fireworks have usually taken over this role in providing a fanfare for the coming year all over the world, from Times Square to the beaches of Rio, to hamlets deep in the English countryside.

This shift from peals of bells to spectacular explosions is suggestive. We live now in a world that is turning its back on the old traditions and the old skills and replacing them with something far bigger and much louder, far more brash and much more expensive; a reminder too of technology and military might.

My new book, "The Seasons," investigates how we are becoming cut off from the rhythm of the natural world and the ways in which the annual cycle has been celebrated for centuries. In the past, the customs and rituals that marked the passing of the year linked society and culture to the environment, and in doing so reflected their values of community and ecology.

Today, however, we are witnessing the eradication of the seasons with all-year produce and the replacement of local festivities with mass celebrations of a tiny handful of uniform events, turning contemporary society into an identikit culture with a standardized marketplace.

My answer is not only that we should revive forgotten customs, but that we can also establish new traditions that properly reflect today's values and ambitions.

In fact, the celebration of the new year is an excellent example of how quickly major festivals can be established. Just as many old English festivals have their roots in the classical Mediterranean culture of ancient Greece and Rome, so much of the English-speaking world still follows customs that originated in northeast Atlantic Britain and Ireland 200 or 300 years ago, adapting these traditions to their own climate and culture.

The practice of kissing and singing to welcome in the new year was noted in England by the American novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne in 1856, but there are in fact very few English traditions for New Year's Eve and Day -- not least because until 1752 the new year in England was celebrated March 25.

But in Scotland the practice was to begin the New Year on January 1 with "Hogmanay," which the Scots celebrate with new year customs such as "first-footing." New year celebrations in the English-speaking world are consequently cosmopolitan affairs, mixing Scottish festivities with other European traditions.

Setting the tone

The month of "January," deriving from the Latin "janua" meaning "door," is a transitional time between the old and new, the past and the future. For centuries, January was a key time for setting one's house in order and making plans for the forthcoming year.

Eat a hen in January, for instance, if you wish to live through the year; observe the weather on January 12, to get a taste of the weather for the next 12 months; and note that activities undertaken on January 1 set the tone of work for the rest of the year -- an early version of new year resolutions.

Settle down to some seasonal fare, from nutmeg cakes with currant eyes known as "Pop Ladies" to the wassail cup, a spiced drink shared among family and friends. And there's no need to take Christmas decorations down on the Twelfth Day (January 6) -- that became common practice in the nineteenth century to get everyone back to work.

Before then, it was felt that during the bleakest months of the year in the northern hemisphere there was good reason to keep one's house decorated. So the holly and the ivy, bay leaves, and mistletoe, stayed up until Candlemas on February 2, a tradition that has survived in parts of Canada.

Easter the joker in the pack

The new year also presents a more profound opportunity to reclaim our individuality and our humanity. As we look forward to the coming year, we cannot but be reminded that the calendar of every year is different: days and dates shift (will you have a weekend birthday this year?), leap days and leap years can disrupt the best-laid plans, and Easter is ever the amiable joker-in-the-pack.

The hair-raisingly complicated calculation of Easter, based on both the spring solstice and the lunar cycle, is currently computed by Catholic astronomers using a 14-step algorithm. Even so, minor variations in the Earth's orbit mean that Easter cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.

It is a humbling reminder of the limits of human control -- and also wonderfully appropriate that such unpredictability can still structure everything from university terms to television schedules, let alone family customs in making and hiding Easter eggs.

Quirky and changeable the year may be, but then so are we -- let's celebrate that.

(CNN) -- Football's world governing body FIFA has provisionally suspended outgoing Executive Committee member Chuck Blazer for 90 days "based on the fact that various breaches of the Code of Ethics appear to have been committed" by the American.

The former general secretary of CONCACAF, the body which governs football in North and Central America and the Caribbean, has been barred from taking part in "any kind of football-related activity" for a maximum period of 90 days.

The decision was taken by Hans-Joachim Eckert, the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee -- which opened investigation proceedings against Blazer, 68, in response to a report filed by the CONCACAF Integrity Committee last month.

"The decision was taken following a request made by the acting deputy chairman of the investigatory chamber of the Ethics Committee, Robert Torres, based on the fact that various breaches of the FIFA Code of Ethics appear to have been committed by Chuck Blazer and that a decision on the main issue could not be taken early enough," read a Fifa statement.

The announcement comes less than one week after fellow FIFA executive committee member Vernon Manilal Fernando of Sri Lanka was banned for eight years for unethical behaviour.

The CONCACAF report alleged that Blazer, who has been provisionally banned pending a full disciplinary hearing, received at least $15 million in addition to other funds that were used to buy and rent luxury apartments.

Blazer, who has been the most senior American official at FIFA for the last 16 years, had previously said that he will give up his seat on the Executive Committee when his term expires at the end of this month.

He resigned as CONCACAF's general secretary in 2011, after serving with the body for 21 years.

In April, the head of CONCACAF's integrity committee, David Simmons, described Blazer and his former boss, Trinidadian Jack Warner, as being 'fraudulent in their management' of the continental organization.

The former colleagues fell out in 2011 when Blazer reported Warner and Asian Football Confederation chief Mohamed bin Hammam to FIFA's Ethics Committee, accusing the duo of trying to bribe Caribbean delegated to support the Qatari bin Hammam in that year's FIFA presidential election.

Blazer's accusations led to the downfall of bin Hammam, the resignation of Warner as a FIFA vice president and CONCACAF leader, and sanctions against several Caribbean football officials.

Now however, Blazer finds himself in the dock alongside Warner.

Last month, Simmons accused both men of abusing their "position and power" -- with Warner said to have failed to disclose the creation of a $25.9 million CONCACAF center of excellence on his land, while Blazer was accused of mismanaging funds.

Both men have denied any wrongdoing.

FIFA has been affected by numerous corruption scandals in recent times, which do not only involve the likes of Warner, Blazer and Manilal.

Last week, former president Joao Havelange - who ruled the organization between 1974 and 1988 - resigned as FIFA's honorary president after the 96-year-old was ruled to have taken bribes in a report by ethics chairman Eckert.
Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- He ventures into the forest looking for his daughters, armed with bow and arrow in case the terrorists surprise him.

The odds are stacked against him. No one has found the 276 girls abducted from their school last month by the terror group Boko Haram.

But then again, no one's really been looking, the father says.

That night of horror

The father's voice shakes as he recalls the night his two daughters were snatched from their dormitory at an all-girls school in Nigeria.

It began with an explosion so loud that it shook buildings in the northern village of Chibok, waking the girls' family. That was quickly followed by the sound of gunfire echoing into the dark night.

By the time father made it to the Government Girls Secondary School, the militants had already opened fire on security guards and set buildings on fire.

Unarmed, there was nothing the father could do but watch ... and wait.

"When I went into the school compound, nobody will ever stand it," said the father, who is not being identified for fear of reprisals from attackers or the government.

"You will see their dresses cut out all over. And the hostel and dormitory, everything was bombed into ashes. So this man told us they have gone with our daughters. We couldn't believe him."

Armed members of Boko Haram attacked the school on April 14, overpowering the guards and herding the girls onto waiting trucks, according to accounts of that night.

The trucks disappeared with the girls into the dense forest bordering Cameroon, a stronghold for the terror group whose name translates to "Western education is sin" in the local Hausa language.

That's where the story gets hazy.

Mixed messages from the government

There are questions about just how many girls were taken, with varying reports putting that number between 230 to 276, depending on who is talking.

In the days after the attack, the military said all the girls had been released or rescued. But after the girls' families began asking where their daughters were, the military retracted the statement.

This much the father knows for sure: His two daughters are among those still in captivity after almost a month.

Nigerian officials have defended their response and said they are searching.

"We've done a lot -- but we are not talking about it," presidential spokesman Doyin Okupe said. "We're not Americans. We're not showing people, you know, but it does not mean that we are not doing something."

But the father scoffed at the government's response.

"We have never seen any military man there," he said.

"Had it been military men who went into the bush to rescue our daughters, we would have seen them."

'We can't let this be the new normal'

Terrorists fill the void

Boko Haram, on the other hand, is entrenched in the region.

The father believes that either supporters or members of Boko Haram live in his village.

They know his family, the father says. They know about his daughters.

The family is so afraid, he says, that they have fled their home and taken to sleeping in the bush.

"Life is very dangerous in Chibok right now. Since on 14th of April, to date, we don't sleep at home," the father said.

They're not alone. The father said that starting around 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening, "people will disappear into the bush because there is no security."

"We sleep in the bush with all of our little ones," he said.

A violent force, a mother's plea

Boko Haram is a ruthless, powerful force.

The group says its goal is to impose stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.

Under its version of Sharia law, women should be at home raising children and looking after their husbands, not at school learning to read and write.

A video that surfaced this week showed a man claiming to be the group's leader saying he will sell the hundreds kidnapped girls.

"I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah," said a man claiming to be Abubakar Shekau. "There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women. I sell women."

The mother of the two girls had little response, just tears.

"Most of the women, we mothers, we started crying because had no one to help us," she said. "Our daughters (have) been adopted or captured as slaves. Now ... we cannot even eat."

This isn't the parents' first experience with Boko Haram. They adopted one of their two daughters after her parents were killed by the terrorist group.

The mother begs for the girls' freedom, away from a lifetime of abuse and slavery.

"They don't know, probably one of them are born a president or doctor or pastor or a lawyer who will be helpful to the country," she said. "Why would they molest these little ones? Please ... release them."

(CNN) -- In recent months, Americans have experienced numerous extreme weather-related events, including droughts, wildfires and heat waves.

We've witnessed the warmest spring since record-keeping began in 1895.

Thirty-one states reached record-high temperatures.

The period between July 2011 and June 2012 was the hottest 12 months on record.

And last year 14 extreme weather-related events caused an incalculable loss of human life and cost the U.S. economy more than $55 billion. Understandably, many Americans are wondering if these events are manifestations of a longer-term shift in climate.

Opinion: Why the drought affects me -- and you

At present we cannot definitively link any single extreme event to climate change. But it is worthwhile to consider whether the apparent increase in some extreme events has roots in a larger, longer-term trend, since that would predict a continuation of these events in the future.

That kind of understanding can have practical importance because it can inspire action to reduce economic losses and human suffering â€” often in relatively simple ways. If a region is likely to continue to get rainfall heavier than has historically occurred, for example, then it is sensible for city planners to consider installing larger-bore storm sewers when the time comes to replace aging infrastructure.

The science in this area is getting stronger all the time. In one recently published study, six international research teams led by scientists from NOAA and a number of countries investigated seven different 2011 extreme weather and climate events. In six of the seven, there was sufficient evidence to conclude that climate change caused by human activities played a factor in the events â€” affecting their severity, likelihood or frequency.

News: Extreme weather -- get ready to see more of it

Among those events exacerbated by climate change were heat waves in Texas and Oklahoma, the East African drought and extreme temperatures in Europe and England. On the other hand, the study found no evidence that the devastating floods in Thailand last year were connected to climate change.

Another new peer-reviewed article, the "2011 State of the Climate" report compiled by nearly 400 scientists from 48 countries, documents some of the longer-term trends that are underlying some of these changes. It found that:

-- Carbon dioxide and other major greenhouse gases continue to climb, with the 2011 yearly global average the highest yet;

-- Excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is making oceans more acidic;

-- The Arctic is warming about twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and its sea ice is thinning dramatically;

-- And the globally averaged heat stored in the upper ocean was the highest since records began in 1993.

Such striking trends have strong implications for climate, weather and environmental and human health.

One upward trend is indisputable: At NOAA, requests for climate data have skyrocketed, and those data are increasingly helping stakeholders cope with extreme events. Last year, for example, firefighters in Texas used long-term climate information to prepare for the spring/summer 2011 wildfire season. Emergency managers along the Mississippi, Missouri and Red River basins used NOAA climate data to help lessen flooding, months before it began.

Opinion: Why we should expect more weather disasters

Coastal managers are using sea-level-rise data to protect crucial infrastructure.

Businesses and governments depend on climate information to make smart investments.

Electric utilities count on climate data to anticipate peak power requirements and distribute power where it is needed.

These are the kinds of practical actions that inspire me in my job as we work to make the best science available to understand and reduce the impact of extreme events on families, communities and businesses. These and other measures are essential to reducing the effects of extreme weather events and forging a safer future.

(CNN) -- It's a cliche.

After a shooting, reporters rush to find people who can talk about the accused. Almost always, neighbors, colleagues, friends and family shake their heads in disbelief.

He was such a nice boy, they'll say, quiet. We can't believe he could have done something like this.

Such has not been the case so far with Evan Ebel, 28, the man suspected of killing Colorado prison chief Tom Clements last week.

People who knew Ebel invariably describe him as troubled.

He was an ex-con, who spent years in solitary confinement because he was deemed too great a risk to the prison community. He was angry, violent, and seemingly incapable of accepting the sort of help his prominent family and others wanted to give.

Ebel was lost.

"From the beginning, his son just seemed to have this bad streak, a streak of cruelty, and anger," Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a longtime friend of Ebel's father, told CNN's "State of the Union."

"They did everything they could. They tried. They worked with Evan again and again, but to no avail," the governor said.

"He had a bad, bad streak."

Gun links Colorado prison chief's killing to Texas shootout

Tendency toward violence

Ebel grew up on a quiet street in Lakewood, Colorado, near Denver.

He was the son of Jody Mangue and Jack Ebel, an attorney and former oil executive. By all accounts, Ebel came from privilege, but showed signs of trouble from a very early age.

"He just struck me as angry," said Lakewood neighbor Vicky Bankey.

"I could see him, he'd be running out on the front lawn to come out to a car with his friends and he would have screaming, obscenity-laced arguments with them sometimes," she said.

As a teenager, Ebel was sent to a boot-camp-type program in Samoa, where according to one person who knew him there, almost everyone avoided him.

"He was quite a scary individual, especially by the end of the time. He had engaged in several fights with other students. One in particular he beat up with a broomstick," said Kurt Frey, who put Ebel's age at the camp somewhere between 15 and 17.

"He's gone through so many bad things in his life that really, it just didn't surprise me that he ended up being killed in a shootout with police."

Wanting to make 'Hitler jealous'

Ebel was killed Thursday in north Texas after a battle with authorities that left a sheriff's deputy wounded.

He died just two days after Clements was shot to death at his home outside Colorado Springs.

Authorities have said the bullets that killed Clements came from a gun that was found with Ebel, who had handwritten directions to the prison chief's house in his car.

Police have also said there is a "strong connection" between the killings of Clements and that of Nathan Collin Leon, a pizza delivery driver who was found dead in suburban Golden, Colorado.

No clear motive has emerged in either case.

Investigators, however, have said they are looking into all possible angles, including Ebel's onetime membership in the 211 Crew -- a white-supremacist prison gang.

Clements earned widespread recognition not only for prison reforms but also for a crackdown on gangs.

According to Frey, Ebel's behavior, even as a teenager, suggested he was interested in white supremacy.

"He was very proud of his Sicilian heritage, and he always talked about wanting to kill so many people that he'd make Hitler jealous," Frey told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360."

"He really was racist, but at the same time he did hang around with African-Americans at the camp, so it was very contradictory."

'We know a different person'

A more nuanced picture of Ebel likewise emerges from his mother's accounts.

Mangue writes about her children on a blog she originally started in memory of her 16-year-old daughter, who died in a car accident in 2004.

The site is now also dedicated to the memory of her son.

According to Mangue, Ebel's life took a sharp turn after his sister's death.

"Evan drifted into a dark period, he was struggling prior, but that event threw him over the edge, they were three years apart. He was the protective big brother and in this case, was unable to protect her," she wrote.

"His life deteriorated after that and he just became numb and lost his direction altogether, between using drugs and committing crimes, he was soon put in prison for 8 long years."

Mangue and Ebel's father kept in close contact, sending letters, cards and visiting their son when they could.

He got in shape in prison, became an avid reader and an advocate against using substances, she said.

Mangue wrote about the bright moments of her son's childhood.

Ebel was a funny boy, full of spunk and energy, she recalled. He wasn't afraid of anyone and loved animals.

Once, after a sleepover at a friend's house, he brought home a small gray kitten named Sparkles. The family kept her for 15 years.

"So even though, he is depicted as depraved, evil, we know a different person who was loving, kind, thoughtful, generous and sensitive to many in his family and to his friends," Mangue wrote.

"As determined the media is in trying to pick apart our son, Evan for a good story, they will never succeed, he is out of their reach. He is not imprisoned anymore, his suffering has ended."

Anger at authority

Ebel was released from prison in January, after serving seven years -- three for felony menacing, robbery and assault, another four for assaulting a guard.

It was his second stretch in prison, after doing one year of a three-year term for felony armed robbery.

According to his mother and Gov. Hickenlooper, Ebel was in solitary confinement for much of his sentence. He was deemed too great a risk to be put with other inmates.

Similarly, he spent time in isolation at the boot camp in Samoa.

That time was hard for Ebel, Frey said, and it may have made things worse.

"He had a lot of anger towards authority. He never liked being told what to do and his time in isolation really only compacted that," Frey said.

"Everything was dictated down to the minute, and that really frustrated him."

Ironically, Clements -- the man Ebel is accused of killing -- was a champion of reducing solitary confinement for prisoners.

One thing authorities might never know about Ebel is, simply, why?

His alleged actions might not have a clear logic.

But they at least appear to have a clear trajectory, said Rev. Leon Kelly, an anti-gang activist in Colorado.

"This kid here, who may have tried to find a sense of identity throughout the course of his life now ... in an evil, senseless way, he's found it."

(CNN) -- Jeffrey Ian Pollack, who directed the popular 1990s films "Booty Call" and "Above the Rim" and produced "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" was found dead on Monday police said. He was 54.

A spokesperson for the Hermosa Beach Police Department confirmed to CNN on Thursday that an unidentified woman informed authorities that there was a man down on a walking trail in Hermosa Beach, California, early on December 23. Police responding to the scene found Pollack on the ground by the side of the walking/running path near a tree.

According to authorities Pollack, who was reportedly an avid runner, was not alive at the time he was discovered. He was found wearing a jogging outfit and with a music player. While the cause of death has not yet been determined, police said they do not suspect foul play.

In addition to producing "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" starring actor Will Smith, Pollack was a business partner of superstar manager Benny Medina who was the inspiration for the series.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Pollack and Medina formed a company which became Handprint Entertainment whose management clients included celebs Mariah Carey, Tyra Banks and Jennifer Lopez. The company reportedly folded in 2008.

Pollack also worked with Jeff Beacher, the creator of the Beacher's Madhouse variety shows which were performed at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood. The show has been revamped for a new version with Miley Cyrus hosting and opening December 27 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

"He was my best friend and partner for a decade," Beacher said in a statement. "He was my brother and father in one. Words can't describe how I feel right now."

People we lost in 2013
(CNN)Kentucky is so awesome right now you are probably watching the NCAA men's basketball tournament to see who is going to get second.

The undefeated Wildcats were scary good Thursday night in crushing West Virginia. The score was so lopsided the game was over before the first television timeout.

While the Wildcats won in a blowout, Notre Dame and Wisconsin also advanced to the Elite Eight with less-than-comfortable wins. The Fighting Irish pulled away from Wichita State while the Badgers shook off pesky North Carolina.

During the nightcap a lot of televisions -- outside the commonwealth of Kentucky -- probably changed channels. The good news was Arizona and Xavier played a terrific game in the final contest of the night.

Perhaps you shouldn't provoke the beast that is Kentucky.

In the week leading up to the game, West Virginia's Daxter Miles said, "I give them them their props. Salute them getting to 36-0. But tomorrow they're gonna be 36-1."

Mr. Miles missed his guaranteed win by miles.

The Wildcats smoked the Mountaineers 78-39 Thursday night in a Midwest Region contest that was never a contest. Kentucky raced to an 18-2 lead -- they should have stopped it then -- and had five players score in double figures on the night. Trey Lyles was the Wildcats' top scorer with 14 points.

West Virginia couldn't guard anyone, except maybe the official who went down when he tripped over a Mountaineer waiting at the scoring table.

Kentucky's 37-0 record is the best start in NCAA history, which has Kentucky superfan Ashley Judd super excited.

It wasn't a pretty game for the Wildcats' offense, but Arizona scratched its way past Xavier 68-60 in a West Region semifinal.

Arizona shot 40 percent,  while Xavier wasn't much better at 43 percent.

The Wildcats tightened their defense toward the end, closing out with a 19-7 run that pushed them to a win and a meeting Saturday with Wisconsin. It's a rematch of an Elite 8 game last year, which the Badgers won by one point.

T.J. McConnell topped all Arizona scorers with 17 points while Matt Stainbrook led Xavier with 17 points.

The Irish found the right balance in the second half, putting the Shockers away for a 81-70 victory in the Midwest Region. Notre Dame trailed by 1 with 16:43 left when it went on a spurt that saw six different players score as the lead grew to double digits.

Demetrius Jackson, who started the run with back-to-back three-pointers, led the Irish with 20 points. Two-sport star Pat Connaughton had 16. Steve Vasturia, who one CBS analyst called a baby-faced assassin, chipped in 13 points.

Jerian Grant, a national player of the year candidate, had a rough night shooting, so he set up his teammates for buckets instead. He had nine points but 11 assists.

Junior Fred VanVleet led the Shockers with 25 points while Darius Carter maneuvered inside for 22.

Wisconsin played cool and shot hot from the free-throw line in holding off North Carolina 79-72.

Sam Decker was trending on Twitter but the Tar Heels were concerned about Sam Dekker (two Ks, folks!), the Wisconsin forward who wasn't having any trouble scoring against the fourth-seeded Tar Heels.

Dekker, who was guarded by the Heels' best defender, J.P. Tokoto, sliced his way for 15 first-half points to keep the Badgers in the game. The junior had a career-high 23 points on the night while Frank Kaminsky, one of the best players in the country, struggled. But the 7-foot tall center hit a big three and big free throws as the minutes wound down.

The Badgers were 20 for 23 from the free throw line. Kaminsky hit all eight of his attempts.

Folks also got worked up over seeing Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and actress girlfriend Olivia Munn at the game. Seems like TBS cut to a shot of the two at every break in the action.

How'd you like to be the guy next to Rodgers? He won two U.S. Open golf titles, yet isn't famous enough to get all the way in the celebrity fan shot. It's OK, Andy North.
Lisbon, Portugal (CNN) -- Calling it a significant step forward for the alliance and European security, President Obama announced Friday that NATO will develop a missile defense system to safeguard most of Europe and the United States.

The agreement, according to the president, followed a year of talks to determine the best ways to coordinate efforts to protect members of the 61-year-old alliance.

The system would be "strong enough to cover all NATO European territory and populations, as well as the United States," Obama told reporters in Lisbon, Portugal.

The missile defense plan "offers a role for all of our allies in response to the threats of our times," the president said. "It shows our determination to protect our citizens from the threat of ballistic missiles."

Obama addressed reporters during the first day of what he promised would be a "landmark summit" featuring leaders of NATO's 28 member countries, as well as Russia. By the time it wraps Saturday, the alliance aimed to produce a set of new initiatives intending to reinvigorate and redirect NATO 20 years after the end of the Cold War.

NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced Friday that heads of state had agreed to a new mission statement, calling it the alliance's "road map for the next 10 years." Crafting this so-called strategic concept had been a top priority of the meeting, which Rasmussen last month deemed "one of the most important summits in the history of our alliance."

"This strategic concept reconfirms the commitment by NATO members to defend one another against attack, and that will never change," Rasmussen said in Lisbon. "But it also modernizes the way NATO does defense in the 21st century."

The document, prepared from recommendations made by a panel led by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, sought to build upon NATO's work in Afghanistan to redefine the alliance as a "global" actor that would work with regional partners to combat threats outside Europe.

Under the new plan, NATO will bolster its role in counterinsurgency efforts, as well as the stabilization and reconstruction of key countries, according to Rasmussen. The defense alliance will also develop "a standing capability to train local security forces" and create a civilian arm to deal with other nations and groups.

Obama added Friday that NATO, under Rasmussen, was also looking at how to deal with threats like improvised explosives and cyber defenses, all serving a commitment that "an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all."

Afghanistan will be front and center on Saturday's agenda, with NATO members working with others who have committed resources to the nation and its government to "align our approach," according to Obama. He said that includes having Afghan forces transition, between 2011 and 2014, taking over the security and governance mission in the country and forging a "long-term partnership" beyond that.

Russia's relationship with NATO and the United States is also a chief focus Saturday.

Obama said that starting then, NATO will work with Russia "to build our cooperation with them in this area ... recognizing that we share many of the same threats."

In an exclusive interview with CNN's Chris Lawrence, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said he hoped that Russia's deepening partnership with NATO would cause Moscow to take a "more civilized approach" in dealing with its neighbors.

Russian troops have occupied Georgian territory since its invasion in 2008. Saakashvili, whose country's bid to join NATO has been stalled for several years, said that he hoped the alliance's involvement would prompt Russia to withdraw its troops from Georgia.

"Once Russia becomes less paranoid, more cooperative, more self-confident in a nicer way -- because I think lots of things have emerged from their almost paranoid sense of insecurity -- hopefully, the small neighbors of Russia hopefully will feel themselves more safe," said Saakashvili, who met with Obama on Friday.

Obama reiterated his belief that the U.S. Congress should pass the New START nuclear control treaty, which the U.S. and Russia agreed on last spring but has not been ratified by either nation's legislatures. U.S. Senate Republicans have held up a vote on START, citing a heavy workload, in the lame duck session before a new Congress comes in next year, and concerns about the strength of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

Obama said Friday that NATO leaders had called passage of the treaty -- which, among other things, would restart mutual nuclear inspections and limit the arsenal in the two countries -- critical to European and global security.

"A failure to ratify [this treaty] ... will put at risk the substantial progress that has been made in advancing our nuclear security and our partnership with Russia," Obama said.

The search for a new mandate for the entire alliance comes at a time that 16 of the 28 NATO members have announced cuts in defense spending. NATO officials said leaders are expected to agree at the summit on a list of the top 10 spending priorities, including helicopters, transfer aircraft, technology to combat improvised explosive devices and increased medical capabilities.

The outcome of the war in Afghanistan is intrinsically tied to the future of the NATO alliance, a new analysis from the RAND Corporation suggested. The report, published Friday, warns that the U.S. lead in the war could undermine any future willingness to fight together if needed.

"In an alliance that finds achieving consensus is central, having one partner clearly overshadow all others highlights the real limits of the transatlantic alliance," the report said.

The difficulty and length of engagement will weigh on decisions by alliance members to intervene or aid in the future.

"The scope of NATO's future roles abroad may be more limited, such as focusing on humanitarian assistance or training, advising, and assisting nations that seek support. While these efforts may entail long-term commitments, they would fall well short of committing combat forces," wrote the RAND authors, Andrew Hoehn and Sarah Harting.

The new strategic concept will cite current security challenges facing NATO members in the 21st century, such as terrorism, cyber warfare and piracy.

Rasmussen has encouraged NATO members to be more agile in order to respond to 21st century threats and to continue to invest in military technology despite the global economic downturn. He urged allies to "cut fat, not muscle" and pool military spending.

The United States is pushing for a realignment of military spending priorities.

"We have proposed and hope to have accepted a set of capabilities that the alliance, in a time of dwindling resources, will decide it must fund," U.S. Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder told reporters earlier this week. "Those are capabilities that deal with ongoing operations in Afghanistan, but also capabilities to deal with 21st century threats, including beefing up our cyberdefenses and embracing the deployment of missile defenses to protect European territory and populations against the growing threat of ballistic missiles."

Obama also will hold a summit with European Union leaders, seeking to reaffirm a partnership with Europe that many feel has gone adrift as the United States expands its partnerships in Asia. Jobs and economic growth are expected to top the agenda at a time of growing tension between U.S. and European countries over the way to fix the global economy.

While the United States has pushed for stimulating economic expansion with more government spending, many European allies are tightening their belts.

The future of some 80,000 U.S. military forces in Europe will also be discussed. European leaders are looking for Obama to keep U.S. troops at their current levels, although the Obama administration has urged Europe to share more of the burden of its own defense.

(CNN) -- After nearly 15 months being held captive by suspected Islamic militants in the southern Philippines, Warren Rodwell is emaciated, exhausted but delighted to be free at last.

Philippine authorities found Rodwell, a 54-year-old Australian, early Saturday in the port city of Pagadian on the island of Mindanao.

He had been taken hostage in December 2011, when armed men showed up at the residence where he and his Filipina wife lived on Mindanao.

His captors, believed to be part of the Islamic extremist group Abu Sayyaf, demanded a ransom of $2 million, a sum the Australian government refused to pay.

As his detention dragged on, his family and officials in Australia and the Philippines continued to work to try to secure his release.

Their efforts paid off when a Philippine port employee reportedly spotted a sodden and mud-flecked Rodwell trudging ashore in Pagadian before daybreak on Saturday.

Appearing gaunt with sunken cheeks and spindly limbs in photos and videos after his release, Rodwell is now receiving medical treatment.

He was expected to be reunited with his brother and sister, who are in the Philippines.

Relief for the family

"We're happy and relieved that Warren has finally been released," his sister Denise Cappello said at a news briefing in Manila on Monday.

"I'm sure you will understand that this has been a very difficult and exhausting ordeal for Warren," his brother Wayne Rodwell said at the same briefing. "It has also been a difficult time for his family."

"He is delighted to be free," he said. "He has, however, lost a lot of weight and is exhausted. He will need special medical support as well as time and space to recover."

Reports in the Australian and Philippine news media suggested that Rodwell's family had paid a ransom worth nearly $100,000 in return for his release.

His brother and sister declined to field questions at the news conference in Manila.

The Philippine government on Sunday said that its policy is not to pay ransoms for victims of kidnappings, the official Philippines News Agency reported.

"Having said that, we have no information or confirmation on that alleged ransom that was paid," Deputy Presidential Spokesperson Abigail Valte said.

A separatist group

Abu Sayyaf, which wants to establish a separate state for the Philippines' minority Muslim population, has been blamed for several terrorist attacks, including the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that left about 130 people dead, as well as previous kidnappings.

Although the Philippine government agreed a preliminary peace deal last year with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a leading rebel group in the country's restive south, some extremists are still active.

"We wish the Philippine police every success in tracking down the group that took Warren from his home," Cappello said.

"We hope they will be brought to justice, so others don't have to experience what Warren has just been through," she added.

The Australian government welcomed Rodwell's release over the weekend, paying tribute to the Philippine government agencies that try to tackle kidnapping cases.

Prime Minister Julia Gillard also acknowledged what his relatives had gone through.

"Mr. Rodwell's family have shown a great deal of courage and stoicism in what has been a tremendously difficult situation," she said.
(CNN) -- It had all the elements of an irresistible story, but ultimately it was too good to be true.

A popular celebrity. Breathless media chronicling his every move. And an affluent Atlanta neighborhood up in arms over a possible new neighbor.

Well, two out of three ain't bad.

Amid rumors that pop star Justin Bieber was considering a move to Atlanta, the Regular Guys, a morning show on Atlanta radio station Rock 100.5, put together a fake neighborhood group and pulled the wool over the eyes of the world's news organizations.

They convinced the media that the newly formed Buckhead Neighborhood Coalition wanted no part of Bieber setting up his new digs in the midst of their old-money mansions.

"The Buckhead Neighborhood Coalition is an organization put together by 'the Regular Guys Show,' " host Larry Wachs admitted Monday after the show's cast completed its "protest" in front of an on-the-market mansion.

The Regular Guys' Tim Andrews played the role of Harold White, becoming the face of the fictitious protest, doing interviews with CNN, the BBC and a host of other news outlets.

"@theregularguys show got 33 international media outlets including TMZ to generate 45,000 plus news stories," Wachs claimed on air.

Andrews, as White, claimed to be a retiree and long-time resident in his interview with CNN.

"We're concerned he'll bring the wrong type of element into a quiet, residential area," he said over the weekend. "It is our position that a person with his means could certainly find a neighborhood more suited to his eclectic lifestyle."

The ploy also included a fake wife he said started a Facebook page to organize the protest.

It warned that "Justin Bieber's relocation to Atlanta can be nothing but bad for our children, as well as the community. Some can't even let their children play in the driveway without fear; he has raced vehicles under the influence, before. What's to say he won't do it again?"

After the mock disgust, the Regular Guys were all smiles on Monday.

"That's a big win," Wachs said of the prank. "That's a huge win."

They marveled at how eager news organizations were to report the story, missing the potential warning signs of new Twitter and Facebook accounts.

"And the great thing was, only one outlet kind of thought it was a troll, and that was Creative Loafing," Wachs said.

As the prank swirled, no one in Bieber's camp commented on the rumored move, which began with a TMZ report. Still, the very idea of Bieber deciding to make the Georgia capital another home was too good to ignore.

There had been numerous Bieber sightings across the Atlanta area: skating rinks, a fast-food restaurant and a nightclub.

Add to that, Bieber has had several encounters with law enforcement authorities in recent months. He was recently arrested in Toronto, accused of assaulting his limousine driver in December.

He also faces charges of drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving on an expired license after being stopped by police in Miami Beach, Florida, last month.

The Los Angeles County district attorney is considering whether to charge Bieber with felony vandalism in the alleged egging of a neighbor's house on January 9.

(CNN)  -- Hours after a security breach forced the closure of a terminal at the Newark, New Jersey, airport Sunday, authorities were still searching for a man who went the wrong way through a checkpoint exit.

The incident happened at about 5:20 p.m. at Terminal C, when an individual walked from the public side to the secure "sterile" side for passengers who had cleared screening, according to the Transportation Security Administration.

No flights were allowed to leave from Terminal C Sunday evening and thousands of other travelers who had reached the sterile area after going through checkpoints were moved back to the public area to be re-screened, the TSA said.

Authorities are reviewing video from airport cameras. They are not sure whether the man was once on the sterile side and went back, or if he never went through screening, TSA spokeswoman Anne Davis said.

Watch more about the situation in Newark

The incident caused arrival delays and mainly affected  Continental Airlines, which is the airport's largest tenant.

CNN's Alina Cho, who arrived at the airport Saturday night on a flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, described the hectic scene: "For the people who are hoping to fly out of Newark this evening, there is not a lot of movement."

She said many passengers who had already boarded outgoing flights had to get off planes to be re-screened.

"I just saw one woman pleading with a gate agent, saying that she had two small children and a heart condition -- that she simply could not take this," Cho said. "But of course, there will be no exceptions."

Flying Continental? Important company notice

Newark Liberty International Airport, which is about 15 miles from Manhattan, is the second-largest hub for Continental.

The airport handles about 35 million passengers a year.

Beijing (CNN) -- A Chinese musician famous for playing a two-stringed fiddle, a 1994 Hollywood drama about two prison inmates, a United Airlines flight bound for Washington and CNN -- what do they have in common?

If you try to search "Abing," "the Shawshank Redemption," "UA898" and "CNN" on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, you receive this terse message: "According to relevant laws and policies, results are not displayed."

These terms have joined a fast-growing list of keywords blocked by Chinese censors as they try to prevent the public from obtaining news on a prominent human rights activist who recently escaped his more than 18 months of house arrest in eastern China.

Chen Guangcheng is now in the U.S. embassy in Beijing, and American and Chinese officials are scrambling to resolve his situation, his friends and supporters have said. In a video posted online Friday, the blind activist recounted the brutal treatment he and his family received during confinement.

While Chen's plight and dramatic escape have made top headlines around the world, news outlets in China, all of which are state-controlled, have mostly ignored the story.

Clinton traveling to China amid tensions over Chen

Major web portals and social networking sites, though not state-owned, have to comply with strict government censorship rules -- or risk being shut down. After launching a campaign to clean up "rampant online rumors," Chinese authorities in late March ordered the country's leading micro-blogging sites -- including Sina Weibo -- to disable their comment function for three days.

Outside a busy Beijing subway station Monday, CNN randomly asked more than three dozen people about Chen -- only two had heard of him and his escape. One of the two, a young man who declined to give his name, said: "It was all over Weibo for a while before the topic was censored."

"It's a typical response by officials and quite a successful strategy in making it extremely difficult to spread information beyond some small circles of activists," explained Jeremy Goldkorn, a leading commentator on China's social media. "But people interested in such things will still manage to find out."

They also get creative in Chinese cyberspace to evade censors, especially on the popular Sina Weibo site, where a third of China's more than 500 million internet users share news and information.

With Chen Guangcheng's name long-since banned, netizens have come up with various code words. The obvious ones, like his initials "CGC" or "blind man," were caught by censors quickly and added to the search blacklist.

Then people tried Abing, the famous early 20th Century Chinese musician who was also blind.

"The Shawshank Redemption" was used to tell Chen's saga as some see the parallel in the storyline of inmates -- Chen was a prisoner in his own home -- enduring great suffering before eventually breaking free.

The United flight number went viral online Friday as Chen was rumored to be on that plane en route the United States. It turned out to be a false alarm.

CNN, like most other international news media, has followed Chen's story for years and provided extensive coverage on his situation since his escape.

Other newly banned keywords include Chen's home village "Dongshigu," "U.S. embassy" and "pearl" -- nickname of Chen's friend He Peirong, who drove him to Beijing and was taken into custody after the news broke.

Despite the official blackout, some Chinese journalists have tried to spread the word in covert ways.

On Netease, one the country's biggest web portals, editors Monday morning posted a clip of a TV news story on the "sudden early arrival" of a senior U.S. official ahead of a scheduled visit by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton later this week. One of the tags for the video was "Chen Guangcheng."

Within a few hours, the 25-second clip has attracted some 25,000 comments. One of the top comments reads: "I know why he came but I can't say it -- or I'd be revealing state secrets."

I took a screenshot of the webpage showing Chen's name and posted it on my Sina Weibo account. It was reposted several hundred times before censors removed it. Chen's name disappeared from the video tags on the Netease page shortly after that.

Since Friday, eight of my last ten Weibo posts have fallen victim to the site's censors. Most of them are related to Chen, including reaction from supporter and Hollywood actor Christian Bale as well as links to my CNN stories.

By Monday afternoon, "StevenCNN" -- my Weibo name -- has become a banned search term.
(CNN) -- They may be famous, but even the world's biggest names go weak at the knees for their favorite football team. Football Fanzone talks to Alastair Campbell -- former spin doctor of ex-British prime minister Tony Blair -- about his 'manic' love for English Premier League new boys Burnley.

Where does your love of Burnley come from?

I was born in Keighley in Yorkshire and Burnley were the big team in that region at the time and they were the ones I fell for. My first game was in 1961 when Burnley were reigning league champions. I started going regularly when I was about five or six.

How did you keep up to speed with all things Burnley when you were in office at No. 10?

I still managed to get to a lot of games during that period. Saturday at three pm was the one time when the Downing Street switchboard knew there was no point bothering me. Tony [Blair] and Gordon [Brown] both follow football pretty closely so I think they understood it. I think Tony maybe sometimes thought it was a little over the top.

Were there any occasions when Burnley came ahead of any high-level meetings?

When we played Scunthorpe -- the game we won to get promoted to the First Division under Stan Ternant in 2000 -- up until then I'd been in Northern Ireland. Bertie Ahern [Taoiseach of Ireland at the time] was a big Manchester United fan and he had tickets for a game the next day. I said to him: "Bertie, I've got to be at this game, these talks cannot drag on and on." As it happened I left early and by the time I'd landed in Manchester things had wrapped up, so he got to his game as well, but I did sneak off early it has to be said.

What does it mean to you to have Burnley back in the Premier League?

It's fantastic. When we were relegated from the top division in 1974 I didn't think we'd come back. We had to win a game against Leyton Orient in 1987 to stay in the Football League. I honestly think if we'd lost that we'd have gone into oblivion so to be back is just incredible. It means a lot to everyone who has followed Burnley through such bad times.

Just how special was that win over Manchester United in Burnley's first home game of the season?

Playing Manchester United as our first game back was the best possible start to the season. Its true they had a bit of an off day, but we played well, and we've played teams who are better on paper but we've beaten them on merit. Our wage bill is the smallest in the league by a mile, we've got a small stadium, we've got the smallest squad and we're the smallest town that has ever produced a Premier League football club, so with all that it's quite an uphill battle to stay up but I think we will, and by playing good football.

Who is your favorite player of all time?

It has to be Leighton James, he coincided with the period when I was really fanatical. He was one of these players that when he got the ball you just leaned forward a bit and you thought something is going to happen here and quite often it did. The other player I'd pick is Martin Dobson, who is now Head of Youth development at the club. He was such an elegant player.

What is your most memorable moment as a Burnley fan?

There are loads. Beating Leeds 4-1 away when Don Revie was in charge of them, is right up there. It was proving impossible to beat Leeds and we absolutely hammered them. The Orient game, obviously, was the most emotional for every Burnley fan. Both play-offs at Wembley have been great, too. I've got loads of bad memories too, but I think it's the bad memories are what make the good memories even more special.
(CNN) -- Five-time world champions Brazil needed to come from two goals down to beat underdogs the United States 3-2 in the final of the Confederations Cup in South Africa on Sunday night.

Brazil celebrated a third Confederations Cup triumph following victories in 2005 and 1997.

Captain Lucio headed an 84th-minute winner to end the hopes of the plucky Americans, who scored twice in the first half-hour in Johannesburg.

Clint Dempsey, who netted in the shock 2-0 win against European champions Spain in the semi-finals, put the U.S. ahead in the 10th minute.

A massive upset seemed to be on the cards when captain Landon Donovan doubled the lead in the 27th minute, but Brazil reduced the deficit just 41 seconds after the half-time break through Luis Fabiano.

The striker then leveled with his fifth goal of the tournament in the 74th minute before Lucio rose highest to ensure that Brazil retained the title.

Brazil went into the game seeking a massive improvement on their dismal showing in laboring to beat hosts South Africa 1-0 in the semi-finals.

But Bob Bradley's U.S. team, beaten 3-0 by Brazil in the group stage, took a shock lead when Dempsey found space in the penalty area to guide home Jonathan Spector's fierce right-wing cross for his third goal of the tournament.

Goalkeeper Tim Howard continued his fine form to keep the Brazilians at bay, then Donovan finished off a superb counter-attack that the South Americans would have been proud of.

The veteran, who earlier in the tournament said his worst footballing memory was a 7-0 drubbing by Brazil when playing for the U.S. under-23 side, set the speedy Charlie Davies free down the left. He then controlled the return pass to cut inside Ramires and slot past Julio Cesar -- extending his national goalscoring record to 41.

Howard then saved a low angled shot from Fabiano, then the Sevilla forward headed over the bar 10 minutes before the interval.

But Fabiano struck a killer blow soon after the restart when otherwise-impressive U.S. defender Jay DeMerit allowed him to collect Kaka's pass inside the penalty area and swivel to fire past a helpless Howard.

Brazil surged forward in search of an equalizer, and Real Madrid's new signing Kaka thought he'd scored it when Howard beat out his downward header via the underside of the crossbar while the Everton keeper appeared to be behind the line.

However, the referee ruled otherwise to the Brazilian's disgust, which seemed to be justified by television replays.

Howard denied Fabiano when clear through on goal in the 70th minute, but soon after the forward was on hand to poach the leveler. Kaka beat full-back Spector down the left and his low cross was deflected into the path of Robinho, who prodded the ball against the underside of the bar -- and Fabiano headed home the rebound.

With the Americans visibly tiring, it was no surprise when Brazil claimed the winner.

Lucio found space in the box to powerfully head a corner from second-half substitute Elano into the net off the left-hand upright, with the U.S. defense having crucially left the post unguarded.

It was Brazil's third Confederations Cup triumph, having also won in 1997, and represented a 14th victory in the last 15 meetings with the U.S.

Coach Dunga has now presided over seven wins in 20 days, with five at the Confederations Cup and two in World Cup qualifiers.
And the winner is ... Yale.

That was the selection made Wednesday by Kwasi Enin, the New York high school student accepted by the eight Ivy League schools -- Harvard, Yale, Brown, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Princeton and Cornell.

He made his pick in style, staging a news conference in the gym of William Floyd High School and delivering the big announcement before teachers and members of the media.

A visit to the New Haven, Connecticut, campus helped him decide.

"My Bull Dog Days experience last week was incredible," he said. "I met geniuses from all across the world. And everyone there was so friendly and inviting. ... And I believe that their deep appreciation and love for music, like I have, was very critical for me deciding to go there."

His father, Ebenezer, thanked all those at the high school who encouraged his son. "We are grateful for all the inspiration," he said.

"People think Kwasi is like an angel or somebody who was sheltered. Really, we gave him a lot of freedom, even though at the same time we were very strict with him in terms of academics and the way he behaved. ... We only pray that going forward he will stay focused and not be distracted."

Referring to Kwasi's 14-year-old sister, Adwoa, their father said: "I told her, Look, I believe you can do better than him."

Enin scored 2250 out of a possible 2400 on his SAT, placing him in the 98th percentile across the country, according to The College Board. He's also ranked 11th in his class at William Floyd High School, a public school on Long Island, according to his principal, Barbara Butler.

"I applied knowing that going to any of the Ivy League schools would be wonderful," Enin told CNN earlier this month. "I thought if I applied to all eight, I figured I'd get into one ... but from the first one onwards I said, 'This can't be happening!' I was shocked seeing all these acceptances under my name."

Butler said Enin is not only a model academic student, but also plays three instruments for the chamber orchestra, sings in an a cappella group, throws shot put and discus for the high school's track and field team, participates in student government and has had a lead role in school plays since the ninth grade.

"Usually kids are good athletes or good musicians or good actors, but they don't have all three and then on top add student government. It's a balancing act. He somehow finds time to do it all and then volunteer at a local hospital," Butler said.

Butler has been Enin's principal for six years in both middle and high school.

"He is an incredibly modest, humble and respectable person," Butler said. "He is incredibly dedicated and he has his priorities straight. He takes advantage of whatever opportunity he is afforded."

Rachel Rubin, the founder of Spark Admissions in Massachusetts, who also previously served on admissions committees at selective universities, said the feat is extremely rare.

"It's quite atypical," Rubin said, adding that most students do not apply to all the Ivy League schools.

"Standardized test scores and good grades will get a student in the door to have their application read," Rubin said. "But it's their extracurricular activities, leadership experience, exceptional talents, recommendation letters and personal essays that will move a student from a pile of 'maybes' to a pile of 'accepted.' "

Harvard's acceptance rate, among the most selective in the country, was just 5.9% for the applicants for the class of 2017, according to its admissions site.

Enin was also accepted to Duke University and three State University of New York campuses.

Enin admitted all along that he favored Yale.

"I really liked their sense of family, relationships between undergraduates and professors, and the residential college," he said earlier this month. "They also have a strong biomedical engineering program, which is a wonderful combination of biology and creative tools that doctors and health care professionals can use."

Enin added that Yale also has a strong music program, one of his beloved hobbies that he hopes to continue when he isn't hitting the books in college.

He hopes to one day pursue medicine, a dream of his that just so happens to align with his parents' careers.

His parents, who immigrated from Ghana in the late 1980s, are both nurses and pushed Enin to receive the highest grades possible and follow his dreams.

"Health care is a prominent field that satisfies people beyond finances and edifies people and is about moral development," he said.

His advice for future applicants?

"Follow your passions in high school and not just follow suit for what you think can get you into these schools," he said. "Develop your outside interests -- not just academics."

(CNN) -- What may be the most famous religious relic of them all, the Turin Shroud, made a rare appearance on Easter Saturday -- on Italians' TV screens.

One of Benedict XVI's last acts as pope, according to Vatican Radio, was to authorize the broadcast of video of the shroud from Turin Cathedral, where the mysterious Christian relic is kept, out of sight, in a bulletproof, climate-controlled glass case.

According to Vatican Radio, only once before have images of the centuries-old linen cloth been broadcast. That was in 1973, at the request of then-Pope Paul VI.

Some Christians believe the shroud, which appears to bear the imprint of a man's body, to be Jesus Christ's burial cloth. The body appears to have wounds that match those the Bible describes as having been suffered by Jesus on the cross.

Many scholars contest the shroud's authenticity, saying it dates to the Middle Ages, when many purported biblical relics -- like splinters from Jesus' cross -- surfaced across Europe.

Even the Roman Catholic Church does not insist the shroud was used to wrap the body of Jesus. Its official position is that the shroud is an important tool for faith regardless of its authenticity.

Archbishop of Turin Cesare Nosiglia will lead a service from the cathedral on Saturday afternoon during which the images of the shroud will be broadcast, according to Vatican Radio.

A video message from Pope Francis was played as part of the broadcast.

In it, he thanked God for the technological advances that have made it possible for the "Man of the Shroud" to be seen by, and reach out to, so many people.

"This image, impressed upon the cloth, speaks to our heart," he said.

"This disfigured face resembles all those faces of men and women marred by a life which does not respect their dignity, by war and violence which afflict the weakest ... And yet, at the same time, the face in the Shroud conveys a great peace; this tortured body expresses a sovereign majesty."

To coincide with the television broadcast, a new Shroud 2.0 app was launched Friday. The app, released in several languages, allows users to scroll over a high-definition image of the shroud and find out more about its history and religious significance.

Giulio Fanti, a professor of mechanical engineering at Padua University in Italy and co-author of the book "The Mystery of the Shroud," said the app will be "very useful" to the scientific community.

Until now, researchers have not had access to a digitalized picture of the shroud, he told CNN. Studies looking into the formation of the image have been based on macroscopic data.

"I hope the app will give us the chance of having microscopic data that will be very useful to confront different scientific research on the shroud, which, until now, is still a mystery," he said.

Disputed dating

Carbon dating conducted in the 1980s suggested the shroud dates from the Middle Ages.

But researchers at Padua University say their more recent tests show the cloth does indeed date back to between 280 B.C. and 220 A.D. -- which could place it within Christ's lifetime

Fanti's book, written with religious journalist Saverio Gaeta and published last year, spells out those findings.

"We carried out three alternative dating tests on the shroud, two chemical and one mechanical, and they all gave the same result and they all traced back to the date of Jesus, with a possible margin of error of 250 years," Fanti told CNN.

For the mechanical test, they constructed a machine at Padua University to carry out traction and compression tests on tiny fibers from the linen fabric, measuring only 10 thousandths of a millimeter, he said.

The test samples were found in dust from the shroud, he said.

Nosiglia said, " ... since there is no degree of security on the belonging of the materials on which these experiments were carried out to the sheet Shroud, the Owners and Custodian declare that it can not recognize any serious value to the results of these alleged experiments."

Author and historian Stephen Mansfield uses the image of the Turin Shroud on the cover of his book, "Killing Jesus," which reveals new details around the crucifixion.

In 2010: Shroud of Turin on display for first time since 2002 restoration

The new research into whether the linen cloth dates back to Jesus' time is fascinating, he said.

"My understanding is that there's not unshakeable evidence but it's more difficult to dismiss the shroud now," he told CNN's Piers Morgan.

"Some of the scientific evidence has proven that it is, as you say, older, that there are some inexplicable factors, in the stains and the composition of it."

He chose to put the shroud's image on his book cover "because it's simply an icon of Jesus in this generation," he said, whether its origins are proven or not.

"People say, 'that's maybe the oldest picture of Jesus' -- they don't think of it being something that has to be scientifically confirmed," he added.

'Truly mysterious image'

Benedict prayed before the shroud in 2010, when it went on display for six weeks at Turin Cathedral, its first public showing since undergoing a major restoration in 2002. Before that, it was last on display in 2000.

The shroud -- more than 14 feet long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide -- was restored to remove a patchwork repair done by 16th century nuns after the cloth was damaged in a fire.

Thirteen years ago, when Benedict was still Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, he wrote that the shroud was "a truly mysterious image, which no human artistry was capable of producing."

The shroud is not scheduled to go on public view again for more than a decade, so the TV broadcast represents a rare chance for the faithful to get a glimpse of the famous relic.

(CNN) -- BlackBerry customers slammed by last week's global outage are being offered free apps, not cash, as payback for their troubles.

At least a dozen apps, which would cost about $100 on the BlackBerry App World site, will be made available in the next few weeks, according to a statement released Monday by BlackBerry maker Research In Motion.

"We truly appreciate and value our relationship with our customers," RIM Co-CEO Mike Lazaridis said in the statement. "We've worked hard to earn their trust over the past 12 years, and we're committed to providing the high standard of reliability they expect, today and in the future."

An October 10 failure at a data center caused outages in Europe and elsewhere, RIm said. RIM throttled service to help address the outage, which spread over the next few days to Europe, the Middle East, India, Africa, Latin America and North America. Full service was restored on Thursday, according to the company.

The free apps include:

* SIMS 3

* Bejeweled

* N.O.V.A.

* Texas Hold'em Poker 2

* Bubble Bash 2

* Photo Editor Ultimate - Ice Cold Apps

* DriveSafe.ly Pro

* Drive Safe.ly Enterprise

* Nobex Radioâ„¢ Premium

* Shazam Encore

* Vlingo Plus: Virtual Assistant

More apps will be added later, according to the statement. The first ones will become available on Wednesday and they'll stay free for the rest of the year.

Business customers also will be offered a free month of technical support.

The offer seemed to please at least some of BlackBerry's roughly 70 million customers.

"Only 1 simple word for this... AMAZING!!!" wrote one visitor to a post on the BlackBery fan site, Crackberry. "I wasn't expecting this at all, but it is welcome."

"Trust restored RIM! ... ," wrote another. "This also tells you RIM is very, very serious with surviving. No giving up for them."

But response was more measured among less-enthusiastic customers.

"What a useless 'compensation'," wrote one commenter on the website for London's Guardian newspaper. "What [if] somebody uses their device for communications (e.g. e-mail) rather than using loads of apps? The value in apps is totally worthless."

Many had been hoping to at least be reimbursed for the amount of time their service was out.

By comparison, after Sony's PlayStation Network went down this spring, the company offered players free games, a weekend of free video rentals and a free month of PlayStation Plus, a premium subscription service offering exclusive titles, discounts and other perks. That PlayStation outage lasted the better part of a month for some customers.
Reluctant approval from Congress for providing military support to Syrian rebels allows the Obama administration to move forward with plans first announced almost six weeks ago.

White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Tuesday that the goal of the military aid expected to include small arms, ammunition and perhaps anti-tank weapons is to keep the Syrian opposition going against forces aligned with President Bashar al-Assad's regime.

Noting al-Assad's forces have been helped by Hezbollah in Lebanon as well as Iran, Carney said Syrian rebels need the help of the United States and allied nations to withstand an increased assault.

"The aid is intended to help the opposition resist Assad and eventually prevail," Carney said, adding that any resolution of Syria's civil war will require a political transition.

His comment appeared intended to soften any expectations that the rebels could topple the regime by military means alone.

A source, speaking on condition of being identified only as an official, said Monday that President Barack Obama can begin acting on plans for increased Syrian aid first made public last month now that concerns of Congress had been resolved.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers said Monday that his panel agreed to the administration's plan for military aid despite reservations about its chances for success.

"After much discussion and review, we got a consensus that we could move forward with what the administration's plans and intentions are in Syria consistent with committee reservations," the Michigan Republican said.

At a congressional hearing on Tuesday on next year's defense budget, GOP Rep. Rich Nugent of Florida said he worried that arming Syria rebels today could mean his sons in the military might face those weapons in the future, if they fall into the wrong hands.

"We want to make sure that we don't put our sons or daughters in any jeopardy particularly as it relates to arming those that we have no idea who they are," Nugent said.

The Obama administration has been reluctant to enter another military engagement, but announced on June 13 that it would provide military support to rebel fighters because al-Assad's forces had used chemical weapons.

Its plans so far stop short of calls by some in Congress, such as veteran Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, to establish a "no-fly" zone over Syria.

In a letter released Monday, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey warned U.S. military involvement would likely cost billions of dollars and include a range of risks for the forces involved.

Eddie Izzard: In Syrian refugee camps, another day of childhood is lost

"It is no less than an act of war," Dempsey wrote to Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee.

The United States has learned from the past 10 years "that it is not enough to simply alter the balance of military power without careful consideration of what is necessary in order to preserve a functioning state," Dempsey's letter said in apparent reference to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Syrian opposition questions Taliban rebel role

McCain, who has long advocated arming Syrian rebels, said Tuesday he was disappointed by Dempsey's letter.

"Most military experts that I know totally disagree" with Dempsey's assessment of the size of the task and U.S. capabilities, McCain said. "The question should be is the status quo acceptable and obviously that is not."

Last month, McCain called for taking out al-Assad's air assets to create a safe zone for the Syrian opposition.

"I know that we have the military capability to impose a 'no-fly' zone, to crater their runways and their fixed installations where fuel and parts are, and establish a 'no-fly' zone with Patriot missiles," McCain said in June.

"And if we can't do that, then the question ought to be asked to the American taxpayer, to the Pentagon, 'What in the world are we wasting tens of billions of dollars for defense for if we can't even take care of this situation?'" McCain said.

Dempsey: Syria intervention is "act of war" that could cost billions

More than 100,000 people have been killed since the Syrian crisis began in March 2011, while refugees fleeing the conflict threaten to overtax government services and destabilize neighboring Jordan.

In Washington, Secretary of State John Kerry met Tuesday with U.N. agencies and other international aid organizations to discuss challenges to addressing what he called a humanitarian crisis.

"We are having a very difficult time being able to access people, move people directly and protect people so we intend to have a very solid, in-depth discussion today about creative ways that we can meet our obligations to human beings who are in huge danger and distress," Kerry said.

He noted his visit this week to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan where he said he witnessed "the dramatic and unbelievably moving ways in which people are separated from homes and family, so many people murdered and killed in massacres and yet somehow these people try to pull themselves together."

(CNN)  -- A passenger plane skidded off an airport runway and burst into flames in the northeastern Iranian city of Mashhad on Friday, killing at least 17 people and injuring about 20, according to government-backed Press TV.

Aryan Airlines Flight 1625 skidded off the runway and burst into flames Friday in Mashhad, Iran.

There were 150 passengers on board Aryan Airlines Flight 1625, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency, or IRNA. There was no immediate information on the number of crew.

An Iranian official said those aboard had been evacuated.

Ghahraman Rashid, deputy governor-general of Khorasan province, said the plane had flown from Tehran, IRNA reported.

"All those killed and injured and the rest of the passengers had been evacuated from the plane and the fire on board had been brought under control," IRNA quoted the official as saying.

He said the plane was a Russian-made Ilyushin.  Watch video of the plane »

This is the second deadly plane crash in Iran this month.

On July 15, a Caspian Airlines passenger plane carrying 168 people crashed in northwestern Iran, killing everyone on board, including 10 members of the country's youth judo team: eight athletes and two coaches.
(CNN) -- Police are searching for any other alleged victims of a Sunday school teacher accused of raping and killing an 8-year-old girl from Tracy, California.

Melissa Huckaby is charged with killing 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, who was a friend of her own daughter.

"We are asking the public if they have any indication that any of their children may have had inappropriate contact with [the suspect] to contact us," Tracy Police Sgt. Tony Sheneman said Tuesday evening. "There has been no indication that this has happened. But she is a Sunday school teacher and did have contact with children, so that is why we are asking."

Melissa Huckaby, 28, was arrested and charged with killing and raping 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, a friend of her 5-year-old daughter.

Huckaby, wearing red jail scrubs over a white T-shirt, was in court Tuesday for an arraignment. She was charged with murder, kidnapping, the performance of a lewd and lascivious act on a child under 14 and rape by instrument.

If convicted, Huckaby would face the death penalty or life in prison without parole, San Joaquin County District Attorney James Willett told reporters after the hearing. A decision on whether to seek the death penalty will be made later, he said.

Huckaby did not enter a plea or speak during the court hearing, although she flinched when Sandra Cantu's name was spoken, and she cried at times.

Sandra's body was found April 6, stuffed into a suitcase and submerged in a pond at a dairy farm. Huckaby was arrested Friday night after questioning by police.

Sandra was last seen alive March 27 in the mobile home park where she lived with her family -- the same mobile home park where Huckaby lives with her daughter. The two children were close friends and played together frequently, police said.

Huckaby is the granddaughter of Clifford Lane Lawless, pastor of Clover Road Baptist Church near the mobile home park, and she taught Sunday school at the church, police have said. The church was searched as part of the investigation into Sandra's disappearance and death.

Before her arrest, Huckaby acknowledged to a newspaper reporter that she owned the suitcase that contained Sandra's body. But Huckaby said the suitcase had been stolen.

Willett declined to comment on any of the evidence or allegations in the case, saying evidence would be presented in court.

A memorial ceremony is scheduled for Sandra at 1 p.m. Thursday at a high school in Tracy, police said.

-- CNN's Ninette Sosa contributed to this report.
(CNN) -- Last month, two political scientists published one of those rare op-eds that gets the political community talking.

The thesis of the piece was contained in the title: "Let's just say it: The Republicans are the problem."

In case that was not clear enough, the authors elaborated: "We have been studying Washington politics and Congress for more than 40 years, and never have we seen them this dysfunctional.

"In our past writings, we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted. Today, however, we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the Republican Party.

"The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics. It is ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.

"When one party moves this far from the mainstream, it makes it nearly impossible for the political system to deal constructively with the country's challenges."

The piece drew its authority from the authors' identity: Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein, two of Washington's most veteran watchers of Congress. Both men have hard-earned reputations for nonideological independence of mind despite their institutional affiliations: Mann works at the liberal Brookings Institution, Ornstein at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. (Ornstein is a friend of mine, and was a colleague until I was given the heave-ho from AEI in March 2010.)

Now they have backed their provocative op-ed with a new book, "It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism."

The book backs the arresting op-ed with a battery of depressing research, substantiating their charge that congressional Republicans now act in a uniquely irresponsible way.

The debt showdown last summer was the ultimate case: congressional Republicans nearly forcing a default on the obligations of the United States to get their way on a budget agreement.

But the pattern manifests itself in almost all the business of government, down to the most mundane.

For example: Because Senate rules often require unanimous consent to move to the next order of business, a determined minority can force delay on almost any action it opposes.

Since 2009, Republicans have used this power of delay hyper-aggressively. Compare and contrast the treatment of executive-branch nominees.

Sixteen months into the George W. Bush administration, Memorial Day 2002, only 13 executive-branch nominations awaited confirmation by the Senate. At the corresponding moment in the Obama administration, Memorial Day 2010, 108 nominees were awaiting action by the Senate.

This comparison is supported by another academic study. The confirmation process got gradually slower between the 1960s and the 1990s. Then, suddenly, in the second Clinton administration, the confirmation process seized up.

Under the elder Bush, a Republican president facing a Democratic Senate, 92% of nominees were confirmed within an average of 57 days. In the second Clinton administration, facing a Republican Senate, only 74% of nominees were confirmed, taking an average of 110 days.

Ornstein and Mann offer a convincing array of explanations for the trend toward radicalism within the GOP, including changes in campaign finance and in the electorate itself. They offer too a range of proposals to work around GOP radicalism and restore the effective functioning of Congress. If those proposals have a faint wistful air to them, blame the inherent difficulty of the problem, not Mann and Ornstein.

But one thing is missing from their powerful and important book, and it's a thought I'd like to enter here into the record: The radicalization of the GOP is a function of changes, not only in U.S. politics, but also in the U.S. economy.

Americans are living through an era of disappointment. It's becoming obvious that the U.S. government cannot meet all the expectations that built up in better times.

The tax status quo, the Medicare status quo, the social safety net status quo, the defense status quo -- they can't all be sustained. Something must give, and almost everybody senses it.

In good times, we debate whether government should expand programs or cut taxes -- new benefits in either case.

In these times, we are debating whether government should impose large reductions in programs or impose big increases in taxes -- taking from people benefits that they now enjoy.

Human beings will typically fight much more ferociously to keep what they possess than to gain something new. And the constituencies that vote Republican happen to possess the most and thus to be exposed to the worst risks of loss.

The Republican voting base includes not only the wealthy with the most to fear from tax increases, but also the elderly and the rural, the two constituencies that benefit the most from federal spending and thus have the most to lose from spending cuts.

All those constituencies together fear that almost any conceivable change will be change for the worse from their point of view: higher taxes, less Medicare, or possibly both. Any attempt to do more for other constituencies -- the unemployed, the young -- represents an extra, urgent threat to them.

That sense of threat radicalizes voters and donors -- and has built a huge reservoir of votes and money for politicians and activists who speak as radically as the donors and voters feel.

Which means the solution to the problems so astutely diagnosed by Mann and Ornstein must ultimately be found outside the American political system -- and will not be solved until America's rich and America's elderly become either less fearful or more generous.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.
Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Jerry Sandusky's wife told jurors Tuesday that she could remember at least six of her husband's accusers staying overnight at their house. She said she did not witness any sexual abuse.

One of the accusers had once traveled with them to the Alamo Bowl, Dottie Sandusky said, where she and her husband shared a hotel room with the boy.

Many of the accusers testified that they knew Dottie Sandusky, who is not accused of having witnessed sexual abuse.

She testified that children would often sleep at the Sanduskys' house and that "we would give them a choice of where they wanted to sleep."

Her husband was also typically the one to put the children to sleep, she said, telling jurors that "he would go downstairs and tell them good night."

Meanwhile, Jerry Sandusky's attorney told reporters Tuesday to "stay tuned" to see if his client will testify in a child rape case that has upended Penn State University and its football program.

"You have to wait," attorney Joe Amendola said just before entering the Pennsylvania courthouse and calling witnesses for a second day.

Sandusky, 68, is on trial on 51 counts related to accusations of sexually abusing 10 boys over a 15-year span. The former Penn State defensive coordinator has denied the charges.

Jerry Sandusky trial: All you need to know

Questions about Sandusky's mental health continue to loom over the proceedings.

Dr. Elliot Atkins testified that he had diagnosed Sandusky with histrionic personality disorder after interviewing the former coach. But a second psychologist, Dr. John O'Brien, disputed those findings Tuesday, saying that the "personality profile Mr. Sandusky exhibited was within normal limits."

The prosecution had earlier presented as evidence what one accuser described as "creepy love letters," written by Sandusky. They argued the letters were part of "grooming techniques" commonly employed by sexual predators.

Judge John Cleland issued an order Friday allowing a defense motion to offer expert testimony from a psychologist who "will explain that the words, tones, requests and statements made in the letters are consistent with a person who suffers from a histrionic personality disorder."

"The goal of a person suffering from this disorder in writing those letters would not necessarily be to groom or sexually consummate a relationship in a criminal manner, but rather to satisfy the needs of a psyche belabored by the needs of such a disorder," the defense lawyers wrote in their motion.

Histrionic personality disorder is part of a class of conditions called dramatic personality disorders, which are marked by unstable emotions and distorted self-images, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Separately, after being subpoenaed by prosecutors, NBC News provided court officials with transcripts and footage of a Bob Costas interview with the former coach, according to NBC spokeswoman Amy Lynn.

"I didn't go around seeking out every young person for sexual needs that I've helped," the former coach told the NBC sportscaster in an interview segment that wasn't part of the November 2011 broadcast, but has since been aired.

Sandusky said there are likely "many young people who would come forward and say that my methods and what I had done for them made a very positive impact on their life."

If the former coach testifies, those comments could potentially be entered as new evidence. Early in the trial, Amendola implied that Sandusky would take the stand.

Closing arguments could begin as soon as Thursday, with the defense expected to end its case midday Wednesday, followed by the prosecution's rebuttal.

Sandusky routinely "got showers with kids" after working out, and he would say so later, Amendola said Monday. But as the trial nears its end, it remains unclear if Sandusky will speak.

Ron Kuby, a veteran criminal defense attorney, said there has been a "tsunami of evidence against him" and suggested that the former coach should take the stand.

Sandusky's child sex abuse allegations: In his own words

"Just maybe he can convince one juror to hold out," the lawyer said. "A hung jury, right now, is a lot better than life without parole."

Prosecutors wrapped up their case Monday morning with brief testimony from the mother of one of the alleged victims.

"He gave him clothes, he gave him gifts," the mother of an accuser called Victim 9 testified. "I just wish he'd given him underwear to replace the underwear I could never find in my laundry."

The final prosecution witness testified Monday that her son seemed to suffer from stomach ailments during the times he was visiting Sandusky and sometimes did not want to visit the former Penn State assistant's home.

But she said she didn't ask him about any possible abuse and still does not know what happened to him.

"I didn't really want to hear," she said, crying.

The defense then opened its case with a former Penn State coach who testified about Sandusky's stellar reputation in the community.

Richard Anderson said it was not uncommon for coaches and youths to use the shower at the same time, and that he had never seen anything inappropriate between Sandusky and a child.

The defense called five other witnesses who also said Sandusky had a stellar reputation in the community.

A main focus of the defense's strategy may be to attempt to poke holes in the prosecution's case thus far.

"A lot of people lied," Amendola said last Monday in his opening statement.

Over four days, several people testified that Sandusky forced them to engage in sexual acts with him in various places, including showers in the Penn State coaches' locker room, hotel rooms and the basement of his home.

'Sandusky 8' describe seduction, molestation, betrayal

One told jurors that Sandusky -- whom he met, like many of the accusers, through the Second Mile nonprofit for disadvantaged youths that the ex-coach founded -- had threatened him if he told others about the abuse. Another said Sandusky warned he might send him home from a trip to Texas, where they'd gone to watch a Penn State bowl game.

The defense could challenge the accusers' timetable, questioning if Sandusky could have committed the crimes they claim he did when they say he did.

What is histrionic personality disorder?

On Monday, prosecutors dropped one of the 52 counts against Sandusky because the statute he was charged with wasn't in effect on the date of the alleged incident.

The accuser said the incident occurred in 1995 or 1996, but the unlawful contact with a minor statute didn't apply until 1997.

(CNN) -- "My brothers."

That is how President Obama should begin one of the most significant speeches of his presidency: the commencement address at Morehouse College this Sunday. Addressing the historically black all male institution gives Obama an opportunity to rectify his strategic neglect of African-Americans. In this high-profile talk to his own demographic, the president has some explaining to do.

Obama's identity as a black man is usually communicated subliminally, with the swag in his walk, the basketball court on the East Lawn, the sexy glances at the first lady, his overall cool. Now, however, comes the time to be explicit: to speak out loud his affiliation, his fraternal pride and concern. That's the good work that calling us "brothers" would do.

In appearances before African-American audiences, the president sometimes sounds like he's saying the wrong thing. He told the Congressional Black Caucus to "stop grumbling, stop complaining, stop crying." In a Father's Day talk at a black church in Chicago, he criticized "too many fathers" for "acting like boys not men."

African-American men certainly could use an intervention from the most successful African-American man in history. They are on the bottom of many indicators of achievement. They suffer the highest level of incarceration, and the largest homicide rates, of any Americans. In urban areas, fewer than half graduate from high school. Their unemployment is among the highest in the country.

"I'm sorry I haven't done more."

The president has not spoken out forcefully against racial profiling and mass incarceration. He has not memorialized the mainly African-American victims of gun violence in Chicago the way he has memorialized the mainly white victims of gun violence in Newtown and Columbine. Asked why he hadn't done more to remedy the catastrophic rate of African-American unemployment, Obama said, "I can't pass laws that say I'm just helping black folks. I'm president of the entire United States."

"Thank you for your support."

Nobody understands, like this audience will, the contortions a successful African-American man has to make to fit in but stand out, to be strong but not intimidate or frighten, to be black enough but not too black.

But in some ways the African-American community has been too understanding. Emanuel Cleaver, while chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said "the president knows we are going to act in deference to him in a way we wouldn't to someone white." Politically it was not the smartest thing to say (the LGBT community didn't turn Obama into the most gay friendly president in U.S. history by going easy on him) but any black man could understand the sentiment. That's why the African-American turnout for the president's re-election was higher than the white turnout.

Now blacks who supported the president are doing exactly what other groups responsible for his victory are doing: waiting for him to return the favor.

"We've all got to do better."

The president isn't the only black man who needs to step up support of his brothers. My friend runs a mentoring organization for black boys in Prince George's County, Maryland, the nation's most affluent black community. There is a long waiting list of boys, mostly without dads in the home, and only about 10 active African-American male mentors.

President Obama provides, for Morehouse men and everyone else, a 21st century model of African-American masculinity. His oft stated support for women's rights is a crucial component. The casual misogyny of some black popular culture, especially hip-hop music and videos, is a disgrace. It's OK for the president to note that not every aspect of black male culture is praiseworthy.

"That includes me."

The government's primary intervention for black men is to lock them up. President Obama cannot, on his own, reverse this course, but he can do much more than he has to disrupt the flow of the one in three young black men who are headed to prison. One example would be to speak in favor of decriminalizing marijuana, as have other politicians like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

Black men are selectively arrested for marijuana crimes, and these arrests have a stigmatizing effect on future employment and earnings that redounds to the detriment of African-American families. Barack Obama was once a young black man who smoked pot, and it would be surprising if he actually believes that it's fair for other young black men to be selectively prosecuted for that.

"I am the most powerful man in the world, and I've got your back."

Those are words profound enough to make a black man cry. I believe them to be true, but hearing them proclaimed out loud would be incredibly meaningful. African-American men feel a special kinship with this president. How inspiring it would be for the president to acknowledge this connection, in his words and in his actions. What a difference it might make for the millions of black boys who now are headed to destinies very different from graduating from Morehouse College or becoming president of the United States.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Butler.
(CNN) -- Over the past couple of weeks, I have been asking random people who identify as Republicans if they trust Mitt Romney, and each of them gave me an answer like this -- "I trust him more than I trust Obama." It's just a long winded way of saying "no."

They said they did want to see his taxes.

They said they have reservations about a major tax plan lacking specifics.

Some said they saw the video of him describing himself as a pro-abortion rights moderate; others knew that in the hardcover version of his book "No Apology," he expressed pride in Romneycare and believed that "we can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country." They know he flip flops.

Misspeaks.

Lies.

And yet, their dislike of President Barack Obama is so strong that they're willing to overlook that whole character thing and swallow the bitter pill that is Romney.

How can they do that, you say?

Well for starters, Obama isn't exactly a rock of Gibraltar himself.

Politifact's "Obameter" has been keeping track of the more than 500 promises the president made during the 2008 campaign and found thus far he's kept 37% of them. He's broken 16%, compromised on 14% and is still working on another 22%.

So even though Romney smells, Obama's not exactly lilacs.

He promised to address gun control. He hasn't.

He promised to close Gitmo. It's still open.

Obama was for gay marriage, then he was against it, and now he's for it again.

If you believe his evolution wasn't about politics, then you probably believe Jimmy Carter was robbed in 1980.

This is why some Republicans are willing to vote for a guy they may not trust: He's viewed as the lesser of two evils. But pointing out the evils in the other party does nothing to address the evils in their own.

Here's the thing: The question of trusting Mitt Romney has nothing to do with Barack Obama.

It's about Romney.

Voters might not like to think about that too much, but they need to look beyond campaign sleight of hand to give it some serious thought because the future of the middle class depends on it.

This week, both Romney and VP hopeful Paul Ryan have been touting a multitrillion dollar tax-cutting plan with no details, essentially asking voters to take it on faith that it'll all work out. Many conservative pundits, including George Will, say Romney's math -- where it exists -- is a bit fuzzy and all Romney can say is "trust me."

So again, I ask Republicans: Do you?

Not in comparison to Obama, but in comparison to your understanding of the word trust. Knowing what you know -- and don't know.

Because if he wins, saying "I trust him more than I trust Obama" is not going to help matters in January. It's not going to protect the middle class' ability to write off the interest on their mortgages or deduct charitable giving. Romney said the plan won't touch those deductions, but he won't tell us which deductions it will touch.

Trust him with our taxes, he says.

And yet, he won't trust us to even look at his.

At the Republican National Convention, Mitt's wife, Ann, painted a picture of their early years together as if the two of them were barely getting by. And then an old Boston Globe interview surfaced in which she said "we were happy, studying hard. Neither one of us had a job, because Mitt had enough of an investment from stock that we could sell off a little at a time."

Realizing that struggling college students work and don't usually live off investments, she backed away from her earlier characterization, telling "Meet the Press" later that, "Mitt and I do recognize that we have not had a financial struggle in our lives."

Uhm ... you do know that she didn't just realize this, right?

You do know that her speech was designed to manipulate voters in an attempt to paint her husband as a regular Joe, a guy just like them, someone they could trust.

So ... do you?

Do you trust Mitt Romney?

Obama has only kept 37% of his promises. But Politifact's GOP Pledge-O-Meter, which they describe as having followed "dozens of promises made in 2010 by Republican leaders" and in their Pledge to America, found that the GOP has only kept 19% of its promises.

If you can't trust a guy who has only kept 37% of his promises, how do you trust leaders that have only kept 19% of theirs?

Better yet, how do you trust a guy, who as governor of Massachusetts, signed an assault weapon ban in 2004, reiterated his support for a ban in 2007 and then shows up at an NRA convention in 2012 talking like some sort of John Wayne wannabe?

I don't think you can.

Which I guess is why many Republicans have a hard time saying they do.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.
(CNN) -- Two of Turkey's main political parties are pushing for a constitutional amendment to lift bans on headscarves at public universities, a move that has caused concern among Turkey's secular population.

The lifting of the ban on headscarves has caused concern among Turkey's secular population.

Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan initiated the move, saying it would create equality in Turkey's higher education.

The constitutional commission will discuss the proposal -- submitted by the AKP and MHP parties -- in the coming days before sending it to the floor for a vote.

If approved, it would need President Abdullah Gul's approval, which is expected.

Under the proposal, veils, burqas or chaddors -- all of which cover a woman's face -- would not be allowed.

Bans on headcoverings were imposed in the early 1980s by Turkey's universities because they were seen as political symbols and conflicted with Turkey's secular governing system.

The proposal to change Turkey's constitution sent chills through Turkey's secular population. Women's groups went to parliament Tuesday to voice their rejection.

"This is a direct threat to the republic and its foundations," said Deniz Baykal, leader of Turkey's main secular party, CHP.

Another CHP lawmaker said she fears that if the proposal is enacted, parents will feel pressure to have their daughters wear headscarves, even in elementary school.

Mustafa Akaydin, head of Turkey's Higher Education Commission, is against the proposal. He said that allowing headscarves would be a rejection of Turkey's secular system of government.

"It is an attempt to create a counterrevolution," Akaydin said. "It will be a breaking point."

He said a majority of female high school students at one school were wearing headscarves during last weekend's entry exams -- a rarity in Turkish schools.

The Higher Education Commission will meet Friday in Ankara to discuss the proposed changes. E-mail to a friend
(CNN) -- Sometimes it takes just one.

One person-- one idea -- to ignite a movement that changes lives.

Helping the millions of people who've fled the war in Syria may seem a challenge far too big for small relief efforts. The U.N. calls it the worst humanitarian crisis in a generation. The needs are staggering.

And yet, for some people, it's just not an option to do nothing.

I AM NOT A TOURIST

Tanya Khalil says she refuses to be a neutral observer. Her country, Lebanon, is taking in more Syrian refugees than any other -- nearly 1 million at last official count -- despite its tiny size.

The university student says it's impossible to walk the streets of Beirut without seeing reminders of the suffering -- some refugees searching for food, others sleeping on sidewalks.

"We cannot think somebody else will take care of it," Khalil says. "We are that somebody. Each and every one of us is that somebody and it is our duty towards one another to be caring and compassionate souls."

Khalil started a group called I AM NOT A TOURIST. The name was meant as a wake-up call to her fellow Lebanese -- that the Syrian crisis was now on their doorstep and they could no longer act like bystanders.

She couldn't stand the thought of Syrian refugees shivering in brutally cold temperatures while she and her friends were sleeping in their warm beds.

They began collecting winter clothing and blankets for refugees in Akkar and the Bekaa Valley in north Lebanon. Khalil estimates 4,500 people donated items, filling 25 huge trucks. "We ended up with more than 10,200 'bags of love,' " she says.

Unlike other host countries, Lebanon has no formal refugee camps. Refugees there are scattered across some 1,600 locations, complicating aid distribution. Khalil partnered with established NGOs to help with logistics: Sawa for Syria and War Child Holland.

The United Nations estimates nearly 2.5 million Syrians are seeking shelter in Lebanon and in other neighboring states, but that accounts for only registered refugees. The true number could be much higher. And the crisis is only getting worse, as thousands of Syrians flee across the border each day.

Sweaters for Syria

Ranya Alkadamani was half a world away when she felt compelled to help. It all started with a conversation with her brother.

An Australian citizen living in Perth, Alkadamani has Syrian parents and family in Beirut. Her brother was heading to Beirut and asked if she had any old sweaters that he could take for a U.N. relief effort.

She said sure -- and then realized she could do something even bigger.

She sent an e-mail to work colleagues, asking if they had any sweaters to contribute. The note touched her boss, who called her and said he wanted to help start a campaign and that he would pay for shipping the sweaters.

It became known as Sweaters for Syria.

Alkadamani says she was overwhelmed by the response. She was worried that they wouldn't receive enough donations to fill even one container, but "in two weeks, we pretty much filled the Salvation Army's warehouse with 1,000 bags."

The campaign inspired people across Perth. One 6-year-old boy is said to have collected 600 sweaters on his own. "When people know there's something tangible that they can do to make a difference, they'll do it," Alkadamani says.

She cried when she saw all the bags piled up in the warehouse -- 100,000 sweaters in all. "Everyone was so generous and they cared as much as I did, and they're not even Syrian," she says. "That was overwhelming."

The bags were delivered to the UNHCR for distribution in Turkey and Jordan. Alkadamani visited Jordan this month, helping to hand out sweaters to refugees who were crossing the border.

She also visited Zaatari, a sprawling camp in the desert now home to nearly 125,000 refugees. That effectively makes it one of the largest cities in Jordan, and one of the largest refugee camps in the world.

Life is harsh there, a far cry from the comforts of home refugees left in Syria. The war doesn't discriminate -- people from all walks of life have been forced to leave behind virtually everything they own. Alkadamani says she wants the world to understand that "the people in those camps are just like you and me."

Khalil also stresses that point. She says Syrian refugees are just normal people -- from doctors to pharmacists to teachers -- with normal lives before the war tore their world apart.

You can do something too

Major aid agencies like UNHCR are overwhelmed with the sheer scale of this crisis, so grassroots efforts can play an important role in filling the gaps. Aid organizations also encourage groups to raise cash donations, as they provide the flexibility to meet particular needs by trained relief workers.

In all of these ways, individual efforts can make a difference in the face of enormous suffering.

It starts with a simple idea -- and the willingness to act.

(CNN) -- George H.W. Bush turns 90 today (June 12), only the fourth American president to reach that age. He's the last of the World War II presidents, the last American leader to preside over the Cold War, the last of a generation of elected leaders who saw themselves as old-fashioned public servants rather than cutthroat campaigners.

Today, there are college graduates who weren't even born when he left office. So the question is, what can 20-somethings learn from an old man like Bush?

It starts with what Bush said to a group of young people in one of the last speeches he gave as President: "What all of us seek in our life is meaning and adventure. It's through service that all of us can find both."

He certainly has had 90 years of "meaning and adventure" â€” flying as one of the youngest Navy pilots in World War II; serving in Congress during the 1960s; as US liaison to China in the days of Mao; as chair of the Republican Party during Watergate; as head of the CIA after the Church Commission; as Ambassador to the United Nations during the Cold War; as Vice President during the Reagan Revolution; as President during the collapse of the Soviet Union.

And as a post-presidential humanitarian, he has raised millions for cancer research and disaster relief alongside the man who was his most bitter political rival.

Bush had a front-row seat to most of the major events of the second half of the 20th century, and he did it by dedicating his life to service to others.

"Public service is a noble calling," something he's said so often that it's engraved on a bust at his Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University. (The students rub its brass nose for good luck; he once quipped, "Thank God it was only a bust!")

I asked about Bush's formula for meaning and adventure when I interviewed 41 extraordinary people for our new documentary about our 41st president, "41ON41." Many of the 41 spoke of Bush's lifelong commitment to public service, whether in uniform, in appointed positions, through elected office or in community service.

"This man has affected this country and served this country in so many ways," said sports commentator Jim Nantz, "and he's done it every step of the way with a kind heart, with good intentions, with real concern that he's doing the right thing to help people."

"I do believe, if there were more people like him, the world would be a better place," President Bill Clinton told me. "If your primary motivation is to serve, then, in an imperfect world, you're likely to make the right rather than the wrong compromises.

"His primary motivation was to serve. You don't get to pick the time you serve, and you can't control the circumstances in which you govern. There's always some good and some bad in it. But he made the most of a hand that was not the easiest hand to play. And he did it because, at heart, he's a servant."

Pierce Bush is G.H.W.'s grandson, and the two have talked about the day his grandfather decided to make the first step in a lifetime of service.

"He remembers sitting in an Andover [High School] auditorium right after Pearl Harbor was attacked," Pierce said. "There was this spirit that he wanted to be a part of. He wanted to go and defend America, he wanted to be a part of something bigger than himself."

Pierce sees the parallels with his generation -- in the same longing millennials have to be a part of something larger than oneself. His Twitter homepage quotes his grandfather: "Any definition of a successful life must include service to others."

Pierce works for Big Brothers Big Sisters in Houston and would tell you that his life is full of both meaning and adventure.

Condoleezza Rice is concerned that young people have only seen the worst of elected officials in a gridlocked Washington that seems to feed on character assassination. She knows how hard it is to decide to go into public service in such a poisonous environment.

"I would say to young people: Never forget that democracy depends on its citizens to care about it, to promote it, to work for it," Rice said. "Democracies don't survive if citizens simply leave it to others to do the hard work of governing, and so if you get a chance to be in public service, do it. The greatest thing that you can do in your life is to serve your country. You could have no better role model than George H. W. Bush."

Bush's life is full of lessons for young people. I hope you'll tune in to CNN on Father's Day at 9 p.m. ET to hear more about this remarkable American life. You'll be surprised how much you'll learn.
(CNN) -- On the morning of August 5, my uncle, Satwant Singh Kaleka, and five other innocent people were gunned down in our place of worship, the Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. The tragedy left us wondering what it will take to stem the growing tide of hate crimes and violence plaguing our nation.

The Senate is holding a hearing on domestic terrorism on Wednesday, and I hope it will do more than simply offer my community a chance to vent frustrations and appeal for sympathy. My hope is that the hearing provides an opportunity for Americans to come together and identify solutions.

We need to be aware that the killings in Oak Creek, as well as recent attacks on the mosque in Joplin, Missouri, and more than a dozen others across the country, will continue if we turn a blind eye to domestic terrorism. It is a significant, growing threat to our safety and freedom as Americans.

We must ensure our safety within our own borders before we can hope to address violence elsewhere. According to the FBI, between 1980 and 2001, two-thirds of terrorist attacks in America were carried out by non-Islamic American extremists. That rose to 95% between 2002 and 2005.

A recent study by the New America Foundation found that non-Islamic U.S. citizens were behind 10 attacks from 9/11 through 2011, while jihadists carried out four. During the same time, 11 white supremacist, anarchist or right-wing extremists were caught with biological or chemical weapons -- anthrax, cyanide, ricin or sarin -- and four attempted to acquire them. The study found not a single jihadist terrorist possessed or tried to acquire chemical or biological weapons.

Eleven years after 9/11, who are the terrorists?

Even more worrying is that  radical right groups are growing explosively, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Yet appallingly, our government has not only failed to increase its efforts to monitor this threat, but in 2009, it decreased efforts, leaving only one staffer in the Department of Homeland Security's domestic terrorism unit, according to Daryl Johnson, a senior domestic terrorism analyst from 2004 to 2010.

We know there are at least 1,018 domestic hate groups in the United States today, many of which promote and explicitly call for violence against those of a different skin color, religion or ideology. How long can we keep our heads in the sand, and how long must we sit by as more innocent people die because a person decides that he won't tolerate the cultural or religious diversity of our nation -- our melting pot?

A coward killed my uncle. A coward, not because he went into a place of worship and took the lives of six unarmed people, and not because he took his own life rather than facing the consequences of his actions. He was a coward because he didn't have the courage to see the humanity of the people around him.

He -- like all terrorists -- killed people because they were not like him, because they were different. The reality is we are all different from one another, and that means we are all potential targets for such violence. This problem affects each and every one of us, so it's imperative that we act decisively, and act now.

This is not a problem that is simply going to go away. The government agencies charged with defending our freedom and safety must make it a priority to fight terrorism not just abroad, but right here at home. And we as the citizens must rid ourselves of the hate speech and the xenophobia -- including Islamophobia -- that divides us. This is particularly true of our leaders.

Opinion: What if U.S. stops policing the world?

We cannot give into the cowardice of prejudice. As the great Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, "We are a nation of many nationalities, many races, many religions -- bound together by a single unity, the unity of freedom and equality." Together we can -- together we must -- address this challenge by calling on our elected officials to do their duty: defend the safety and freedom we as all Americans cherish.

(CNN)Britain's Prince Harry is preparing for a new chapter in his life.

After nearly a decade with the British military, he has announced in a statement that he is leaving the armed forces.

"Moving on from the Army has been a really tough decision," he said in a statement released Tuesday. "I consider myself incredibly lucky to have had the chance to do some very challenging jobs and have met many fantastic people in the process. ...[T]he experiences I have had over the last 10 years will stay with me for the rest of my life."

"Captain Harry Wales," as he is known, from his official title and name of His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales, began his formal military duties in 2005 at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.  The younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana seemed to thrive in a military setting.  He managed to curb his wild ways (for the most part), served two tours in Afghanistan and achieved the rank of captain in 2011.  He has also qualified as an Apache Aircraft commander.

Prince Harry does have a few more responsibilities before he returns to civilian life. He'll spend the last two months of his operational service attached to Australian Defence Force units in Darwin, Perth and Sydney.

"We have prepared a challenging program that will see Captain Wales deploy on urban and field training exercises, domestic deployments, as well as participate in Indigenous engagement activities," said Air Chief Marshal Mark Binski of the Australian Defence Force. "While all our units are highly capable, we have selected those units that best utilise Captain Wales' skill sets and give him some experience of the diverse range of capability we have within the ADF."

Work with wounded soldiers will prepare the prince for the position he will take up in August. He will work in a volunteer capacity with the Ministry of Defence's Recovery Capability Programme and the London District Personnel Recovery Unit.  Both groups assist wounded or sick soldiers either return to duty or transition to civilian life.

"Wounded warriors" are a special interest for Prince Harry.  He helped spearhead and continues to champion the Invictus Games, a competition for former military personnel who have been wounded in the line of duty.

Prince Harry will still have royal duties to attend to while he is finishing his military service.  He will accompany Prince Charles on a trip to Turkey at the end of April, for commemorations marking the battle of Gallipoli. And he will undertake an official Royal tour of New Zealand in May, after his service with the Australian Defence Force is complete.

"This is a big, bold step for Prince Harry," said CNN Royal Correspondent Max Foster.  "The military provided him with an escape from public life. He thrived being 'just one of the guys.'  But, as I understand it, he feels he's reached a natural crossroads in his career. The next steps would be staff college and desk jobs and that's not for him. He's passionate about the military, though, and I don't think will ever lose that connection."
(CNN) -- PGA star Hunter Mahan chose family over work this weekend, and though it may have cost him more than $1 million, he sounds ecstatic.

"What a whirlwind of a day," Mahan tweeted Sunday morning, "but I'm happy to announce the birth of my daughter Zoe Olivia Mahan born at 3:26 am. Thanks for all the support!

"Both Baby and Mom are doing great. Thanks to all to my sponsors who appreciate what's important in life and all my fans for being Awesome!" he added in a second tweet.

Mahan was halfway to his sixth career PGA Tour tournament victory, with a two-shot lead after Friday's second round of the RBC Canadian Open at Glen Abbey Golf Club in Oakville, Ontario.

But after receiving a call early Saturday that his wife, Kandi, had gone into labor, he withdrew from the tournament and flew home to Dallas to be present for the birth of the couple's first child rather than continuing to pursue the $1.008 million first prize.

"Kandi and I are thrilled about this addition to the Mahan family, and we look forward to returning to the RBC Canadian Open in the coming years," Mahan said Saturday, according to PGATOUR.Com.

Mahan has made more than $2.3 million already in 2013, with four Top 10 finishes this year, including a tie for fourth place at the U.S. Open and a tie for ninth place at the British Open over the past two months, PGATOUR.com says.

(CNN) -- The reaction to the death of 23-year-old baseball player Christopher Lane has been swift and far-reaching, stretching from America's heartland to his home in Australia.

Lane was gunned down in Duncan, Oklahoma, while he was out jogging last week. Three teenagers have been charged as adults in his killing.

In Ada, Oklahoma, Lane was remembered as a popular athlete, well-liked by classmates and considered a model student by professors.

"Chris exemplified what a student-athlete is all about," said East Central University President John R. Hargrave in a statement Wednesday. "We will miss Chris, not only for his presence, but the impact he has made on fellow students and athletes."

'Senseless' shooting sparks call for U.S. boycott

People who never met him have turned to social media and the Internet to share their feelings of the tragedy. The emotions range from shock and sadness to rage and disbelief.

That range of emotion is palpable on a website created to raise money for Christopher's family to fly to the United States and take his body back to Australia. The goal of the "Christopher Lane Fund" was to collect $15,000. The total now exceeds $60,000.

Some of the donations are accompanied by statements shared on the site.

"As a citizen of the United States, I am saddened, embarrassed, and appalled by the unconscionable act that took Christopher's life," wrote one contributor, Judy Harless. "I pray for your family, and Christopher, in the hopes that you may find peace after this tragedy. I also pray for our leaders that they find the strength and morality to implement gun laws that prevent such senseless acts and, lastly, for our youth who do not value life, are devoid of compassion, and have no humanity."

Another contributor, Richard Kimpel, put the blame for the "senseless tragedy" on "a society that allows so many young boys to grow up without being taught respect for life. I am so so sorry for your loss. Please find some comfort in knowing that he is in good company with the Lord now."

People have also turned to Twitter to express their feelings, including Los Angeles Dodgers player Peter Moylan. An Australian, Moylan tweeted: "Tonight I continued my dream of playing pro baseball, a dream that was stolen from Chris Lane by 3 cowards."

Lane loved the game of baseball, but he was planning on earning a degree in finance and starting a real estate business with his family.

"Chris was talented enough to play baseball, but he used that as a pathway to a collegiate education," said ECU Director of Athletics Jeff Williams on Wednesday.

Sam Malchar, who was Christopher's teammate at the university, remembered his charm.

"The first thing that you would notice about Chris was his strong Australian accent, which would just draw people toward him, especially in Oklahoma where most people have never heard it other than in the movies," he said in a statement. "But there were a lot more reasons to talk to him than just an accent. You wanted to talk to him because he was the kind of guy who you could tell anything, one of those people you just loved to be around. He was a very witty and lighthearted guy, always able to lighten up the mood.

"Not a lot of people would move halfway around the world to get an education and build a better life, but he did. Chris was a charming guy, a genuinely good person, with great character and had a love for life," he said. "Chris was the kind of guy you want your sons to grow up to be and that you want your daughters to marry. It just breaks my heart knowing how much more he could have brought to this world as a husband, father, son, brother and friend."
(CNN) -- Since the December 14 mass killing in Connecticut, we've seen a lot of finger pointing. Too many guns. Not enough guns. Powerful lobbyists. Insufficient mental health services.

Discussion of possible explanations is often neither civil nor constructive, and based on a closed-minded and entrenched belief that those who disagree with us have their facts wrong.

The victims in Sandy Hook, Aurora and Fort Hood -- all killed or wounded by gun violence -- deserve better.

There are two major ways we can zero in on facts and foster a more informed discussion.

The first is to further develop and meaningfully consider high quality scientific research on violence prevention and mental health. The second is to create more opportunities for public policy discussions that incorporate this research.

Politics: New Congress, new push for gun laws

The scientific literature regarding violence prevention is considerable. Yet important research that focuses on gun violence has been shut down for political purposes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention once considered gun violence a public health issue. The science agency had the freedom to ask important questions: Does having a gun in the home make a family safer? Do concealed carry laws increase or reduce gun fatalities?

But in 1996, the National Rifle Association pressured its many supporters in Congress to put the squeeze on the CDC by cutting funding that went to gun research, with the stipulation: "None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control." Gun-related research ground to a halt.

In 2009, scientists funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism looked into whether carrying a gun increases or decreases the risk of being shot in an assault. In 2011, Montana Rep. Denny Rehberg inserted a provision into a funding bill that extended the CDC restrictions to the rest of the Department of Health and Human Services, ending that similar research. Even Obamacare has been touched by the NRA: The new health care law restricts doctors' ability to collect data about patients' gun use.

"Criticizing research is fair game," Drs. Arthur Kellermann and Frederick Rivara wrote in opposition in the Journal of the American Medical Association last month. "Suppressing research by targeting its sources of funding is not."

Science and engineering research can answer important questions. For instance, can we cost-effectively engineer firearms to be used solely by the registered owner? What's the best way for law enforcement agencies to share gun violence data? Does media attention focused on the killers encourage copycat crimes? Does better access to mental health services reduce criminal activity?

Some findings could lead to policy choices that aren't yet on the table or help determine where we should best focus our attention. Republicans and Democrats alike are warming up to the idea that adequate research can lead to more informed policy decisions. Former Rep. Jay Dickey, the Arkansas Republican who led the charge against the CDC in 1996, recently expressed regret for suppressing firearm safety research.

Just as important, how do all these pieces of the puzzle fit together? Having an informed debate means relying on credible syntheses of expert studies.

To come up with answers, scientific organizations, such as the National Academy of Sciences, could convene independent panels to piece together what is known and what is not known and to evaluate various policy options. The commission set up after the 2010 British Petroleum oil spill is one such example. The 9/11 Commission is another.

Analysis: Guns and the law

When independent experts who are free from conflicts of interest come together in good faith to study an issue, they can have a profound and constructive influence on government policy. At a more basic level, national and state legislative committees should hold more hearings designed to study evidence rather than using hearings as theater to advance a political point of view.

Nongovernmental organizations, including the one where I work, can redouble their efforts to bring scientists and policymakers together. This is especially important after the demise of the Office of Technology Assessment, a research office within Congress that, until the mid-1990s, provided independent analyses on issues up for congressional debate.

In the absence of a reliable base of information we can all agree on, we guess. We interpret the facts to suit our beliefs. We put our faith in the institutions or individuals we trust, whether it's the NRA, religious leaders or gun control groups. And we keep on having the same broken debate.

Of course, the evidence can only take us so far. Moral, economic, legal and political arguments can and should carry weight. But robust research can set the baseline for a discussion and help us make the best decisions for society.

The more polarized, caustic and poorly analyzed an issue, the more intractable it becomes. We need to develop venues for rational discourse about research that is resilient to political pressures.

More robust partnerships among scientists, policymakers and the public can help us work together to address critical challenges, even after they fall from the headlines.

Vice President Joe Biden is leading a task force to address our country's problem of gun violence. One critical step the task force should embrace is to lift restrictions on the research public health scientists can do. And we can all reject attempts to discredit evidence that challenges our beliefs.

Surabaya, Indonesia (CNN)The man who captained AirAsia Flight QZ8501 lived in a picturesque neighborhood in the suburbs of Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city.

We headed there to see if family members or friends wanted to talk to us about him. These types of assignments are never easy. We are well aware that the last thing many people in mourning want to do is to talk to a journalist. I've done this long enough to know that the smart thing is to have the decency to offer condolences and leave if mourners say they don't want to talk.

But this family didn't feel that way. They were gracious and warm to us, and invited us to join other mourners who were with them.

Experienced pilot

The captain of the ill-fated airliner, known only as Irianto -- many Indonesians go by one name -- had been with AirAsia for six years. He had worked for another airline in Indonesia for 13 years before that, and was an Indonesian Air Force pilot for a decade prior.

When we arrived at his home, his wife, Widya Sukatri Putri, answered the door.  She and Irianto have two children; a daughter named Angela who is about to turn 25, and a 7-year-old son named Arya. We told her we wanted to do a story about Irianto, that we hoped to find out what kind of husband and father he was; what kind of man and pilot he was. She invited us inside where we offered our condolences and asked if she would to talk to us on camera. She told us she wasn't sure if she wanted to talk, but invited us to come back later in the morning.

We came back two hours later and the house was full of family and friends offering support to Widya, her children, and Irianto's elderly mother and father. What was taking place in the house was an Indonesian tradition known as a layat, a visitation by people when there is death in a family.  There were dozens of people, old and young, sitting on the floor of Irianto's home. The house was so crowded that other mourners sat out in the front of the house, and some sat at tables that had been put in the middle of the closed off street.

'Kind and loving' father and husband

Widya and Angela, her daughter, invited us to sit down with them, and it was there that they decided they did want to say a few words to us about Irianto. The portrait they painted about this man made it clear that he was kind and loving, fun and even-tempered, hard working and dedicated.

I marveled at how kind Irianto's wife and children were to us, how kind his parents were to us. They were suffering so much, yet they wanted to make us feel at home. I told his daughter not to worry about us. She told me her father had taught her to be hospitable.

Angela is not ready to give up hope that someway, somehow he and other people on the plane might still be alive. But she knows that is unlikely and told us she is prepared to accept reality.

This family made it very evident they were lucky to have Irianto in their lives. We said our goodbyes to this gracious family, realizing that the fated plane's pilot was also very lucky to have them.
(CNN) -- For the residents of Christchurch, New Zealand, time stopped at 12.51pm on February 22, 2011, when a massive earthquake ripped through the city, destroying homes, lives and businesses.

One year on, reminders are never too far away, from the broken buildings to frequent aftershocks that rattle the city every day. Some are too minor to feel; others cause a sharp intake of breath.

"February, 22, 2011... is a date permanently etched into all of our minds, a date that will go down in the history of New Zealand as one of our darkest days," Prime Minister John Key told crowds gathered for a civic memorial service in the city Wednesday.

The magnitude 6.3 quake shook the city for a matter of seconds, but it was long enough to kill 185 people from 14 countries. Many more were injured.

The tremor brought down buildings in the city center in the middle of the working day, trapping workers and triggering a national state of emergency as rescuers scrambled to save lives. Most of the victims -- 115 -- were buried in the rubble of the Canterbury Television (CTV) building, which was later found by a government report to have been poorly constructed.

One survivor, Anne Vos, spoke to the media by cellphone as she lay trapped under her desk in the rubble of the five-story Pyne Gould Corporation building. After being pulled out, 24 hours later, she told CNN, "I was finding it hard to breathe, and I really thought that was it for me. I thought 'this is it - I'm not coming out of here.'"

Anne Vos: A survivor's story

One year later, Christchurch remains locked in recovery mode, a city carved into zones labeled by color to indicate the severity of the earthquake damage to homes and land.

For residents in the red zone, there is no future there. Around 6,800 homes, many clustered along the Avon River, have been designated for destruction.

The government says around 46% of residents in the red zone have accepted its offer to buy their land. Some have cut their ties with the area; others are still wading through insurance claims on homes waiting to be destroyed.

Before the quake, 22-year-old desktop publisher Sarah Boyd lived with her partner in Avonside, a small suburb that has now been condemned.

"It was a tiny wee suburb and nearly every house there has gone," she said. "They said that our house was sinking towards the river. They reckon all land would travel towards the river."

They moved out of the red zone in November, but Boyd said their new home suffered damage during the February quake and subsequent aftershocks, and may also need to be demolished.

Boyd works at the office at the Catholic Diocese of Christchurch, which suffered a blow during the quake with the near collapse of the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. It is currently being propped up with shipping containers while work continues to determine exactly how much of the building can be saved.

The brightly-colored containers can been seen dotted through the city, at the makeshift "Re:Start" mall in the city center and along roads below unstable cliffs considered to be at risk of landslide.

"It's a city of two parts really," said Matt O'Connell, the earthquake recovery coordinator for the Catholic Diocese, who works in the same office as Boyd. Last week he took part in an Ecumenical door-knocking team made up of representatives from varying faiths in the city.

"Even just on one street we met a family there who are struggling for food who had eight to ten people living in a two-bedroom house," he said. "A lot of people are tired, stressed and frustrated. The rebuild seems to be going relatively slowly. There are lots of issues."

Recovery efforts are being hampered by frequent aftershocks. The February 22 quake was one itself, after a larger, magnitude 7.1 quake the previous September. That one ran deeper so caused less damage. The government said there have been 10,000 quakes since last September, including 39 of a magnitude of five or greater.

"We had a really good run from June until December the 23rd, then we got hit with a magnitude six quake, two days before Christmas. It really, really set people back. There was further damage, no one was injured, but it was a psychological blow for many people," O'Connell said.

While people struggle to recover, work continues to rebuild shattered buildings and infrastructure.

Prime Minister Key has said the recovery plan is making "good progress." Construction has started on 26 "significant" commercial buildings in the city center. Work on 80% of the 1,406 buildings marked for partial or full demolition has been completed. And 200 infrastructure repair projects are now underway, he said.

"Long term Christchurch will look much different but it will be vibrant, new and a great place to live," Key added.

Thousands have not stayed around to find out. Population figures released in October, the first numbers made public since the quake, showed more than 10,000 people had left the city in the year to June 2011.

On the eve of the anniversary, the city buried the unidentified remains of four people who were killed in the quake in a new cemetery. It will be one of the more somber reminders of that day.

The city came to a halt for two minutes at 12.51 local time, as residents paid their respects to those who were killed. Tomorrow they'll get back to the long, drawn-out task of rebuilding their lives and moving forward.
(CNN) -- Is a woman's virginity worth $3.8 million? That's how much a 22-year-old from San Diego, California, said she has been offered through an auction she announced in September.

Natalie Dylan, 22, said she has put her virginity up for auction through the Moonlite Bunny Ranch.

The woman, who goes by "Natalie Dylan," set up a private auction through the Moonlite Bunny Ranch, a legal brothel in Nevada. The auction has given her lots of "business opportunities," she said.

Her top bid comes from a 39-year-old Australian, but she has no immediate plans to settle the auction, she said in a recent interview with CNN.

Some men may seek virgins because they want them as trophies, or desire purity. But as to why men would bid so much money on virginity, she said she has no answer.

"I honestly don't know what they see in it," she said.

If you think Dylan's auction amounts to prostitution, she completely agrees. She also said she's not breaking any laws -- after all, prostitution in Nevada is legal.

"I feel people should be pro-choice with their body, and I'm not hurting anyone," she said. "It really comes down to a moral and religious argument, and this doesn't go against my religion or my morals. There's no right or wrong to this."  Watch for more on Dylan »

The idea that virginity has a high value harkens back to the days of early humans -- if a man has sex with a virgin woman, he knows for sure that her children will be his, anthropologists reason. In early civilizations, women were also considered the property of men, said Laura Carpenter, assistant professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.

Through the 1950s in America, women were expected to remain virgins until marriage, Carpenter said. But with the availability of the pill and the IUD in the 1960s, combined with youth counterculture and gay rights movements, it became more common for women to engage in premarital sex, she said.

Attitudes shifted toward the conservative side in the 1980s with the worldwide HIV/AIDS pandemic, which made the stakes much higher for choosing a sex partner, especially for men. Abstinence-based education programs also took off around that time, with government support, she said.

Today, about 95 percent of Americans have sex before they're 25, Carpenter said. But worldwide, virgin prostitutes can claim larger fees, certain cultures still attach larger dowries to virgin brides, and some women undergo reconstructive surgery to restore their hymens.

In looking at Dylan's auction, "To some extent it's not new. The new part is the Internet," Carpenter said.

Dylan is not the first to hold a public sale for her sexual innocence. An Italian model reportedly had plans to sell her virginity for more than $1 million in September. Dylan said she was inspired by a report of a Peruvian woman who put her virginity up for sale.

Some think Dylan's auction may be indicative of a shift in the way society treats sexuality.

"In a world that is teeming with brand messages, with sponsorships everywhere, intimacy is really just the next thing to go," said Jon Ray, a 24-year-old marketing consultant in Austin, Texas, and author of the blog Who is Jon Ray?

Brett Austin Vanderzee, a 19-year-old student at Oklahoma Christian University who has pledged to stay a virgin until marriage, finds Dylan's actions somewhat appalling, but not shocking.

"It's kind of crazy, but I think it's the general direction that society has been heading in for a while," he said. "We're becoming more accepting of things that normally would have been considered unwise."

Kiara Daines, a 17-year-old from Detroit, Michigan, said she's saving herself until marriage for personal and religious reasons. Both Vanderzee and Daines said they have endured teasing from their peers because of their choice to remain abstinent.

Others say there's just too much hype around virginity. Martha Kempner, vice president for information and communications for the nonprofit Sexuality Information and Education Council of the U.S., said telling a young woman to stay"pure" misses the point that sexuality will influence her long after she loses her virginity.

"By putting the emphasis there, [on virginity], we're actually devaluing the rest of women, the rest of her, and the rest of her sexuality for the rest of her life," she said.

A recent study in the journal Pediatrics showed that religious teens who take virginity pledges are as likely to have sex before marriage as their religious peers, and less likely to use condoms or birth control when they become sexually active.

Many people say losing one's virginity has different implications for men than women. While young women see the act as a symbolic giving of themselves, young men are more prone to want to get it over with and brag about it. Similarly, says Kempner, women are taught to keep themselves "pure" and help men exercise control, while there's a "boys will be boys" attitude around men.

Do men really think that virginity is worth millions of dollars?

Audacia Ray, a 28-year-old former sex worker from New York and author of "Naked on the Internet: Hookups, Downloads and Cashing In on Internet Sexploration," is skeptical. She views Dylan's auction as a publicity stunt and doesn't anticipate she'll "continue in the industry."

The importance of a woman's virginity may vary in different cultures, but generally there's not the high value there used to be, Ray said.

"It begins to be viewed more as a burden over time -- a burden in that losing virginity is an event, so that it has to somehow mean something, which is part of the reason why people are all up in arms about Natalie," she said.

How do Dylan's friends and family feel? Dylan, who said she was raised in a conservative, non-Christian religious household, said although her mother doesn't agree with her, she still loves her as a daughter. Generally people have been supportive, Dylan said.

"I've talked with my exes, some different guys, and they understand it's just a business deal, and they know me, and they know I'm not this promiscuous girl. Honestly, even if I didn't do this, I'd always be the girl who thinks prostitution is OK," she said. "I would always want to find a partner that can accept me for me."
Athens, Greece (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has some apple picking to do.

Clinton placed a bet on the women's World Cup finals with her Japanese counterpart -- New York apples for Japanese pears.

The Japanese women's soccer team won the World Cup Sunday after defeating the United States on penalty kicks.

Clinton alluded to the bet in a phone call she placed to the U.S. team to wish them luck ahead of the game. At the time, she didn't say what the bet with Japan's Foreign Minister Takeaki Matsumoto entailed.

"I am sorry I can't be there with you tonight, but I sent my very best good luck charm for one extra bit of luck: my daughter Chelsea," Clinton told them.

Her daughter Chelsea Clinton was among those who attended Sunday's game in Frankfurt, part of a delegation that included Jill Biden, wife of the U.S. vice president.
MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Mexico's tourism director on Wednesday downplayed the risk of violence facing tourists, despite warnings for travelers to think twice about visiting the country.

A cliff diver jumps from "La Quebrada" cliff in Acapulco, Mexico. The diving is a popular tourist attraction.

"In all parts of the world, you have to be careful with what you do," Oscar Fitch told CNN en Espanol. "What I am saying is there are very safe zones and there are zones that are not safe."

In recent days, the United States, Canada, France, Italy and Germany have issued alerts about travel to Mexico, where drug violence was blamed for more than 5,400 killings last year.

The warnings appear to have had little effect, according to Mauricio Baranda, Mexico country manager at Carlson Wagonlit Travel.

"For our part, we have detected no significant drop because of that type of situation," he said. "Much more significant is the reduction [in travel to Mexico] because of the financial crisis."

In an unusual move, the U.S. State Department issued a travel alert last month targeting spring break travelers, for whom Mexico is a popular destination.

"The situation in Ciudad Juarez is of special concern," the alert said. "Mexican authorities report that more than 1,800 people have been killed in the city since January 2008. Additionally, this city of 1.6 million people experienced more than 17,000 car thefts and 1,650 carjackings in 2008." Watch as troops roll into Juarez and officials say it's working »

Some students appeared to be paying attention.

"I think that, if there is a big problem in Mexico, they [students] should go somewhere else, because you never know what is going to happen," said Nereida Solis, a student.

"I think it would be a good idea to consider security things," added Karen Velasquez, another student.

But student Aaron Cutler was more fatalistic.

"That's life," he said. "There is violence in Israel, there is violence in India. I don't know much about the situation and how it has turned out. I can't comment much, but if people want to go, people are going to go."

Mexican authorities said the country remains a preferred destination for U.S. vacationers, but acknowledged that the warnings may lead some of the 18 million who typically visit their neighbor south of the border to find another place to go this year.
As ISIS continues its campaign in both Syria and Iraq, a group called Samaritan's Purse is hoping shoeboxes filled with gifts might give comfort to refugees of the crisis.

On a sunny but windy day on the tarmac of Baltimore-Washington International Airport, volunteers from the group loaded pallets filled with some 60,000 boxes of gifts onto a 747-jet. Those boxes contain everything from hand-written notes of well-wishes to furry toy ponies. They'll end up in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq where they will be distributed to children living in refugee camps in both Iraq and Syria as part of "Operation Christmas Child."

Children from the U.S., U.K. and Canada filled the boxes.

Though exact numbers are hard to come by, the United Nations estimates there are over a million refugees displaced in Syria and Iraq.

President and CEO of Samaritan's Purse Franklin Graham says it's important to try and help these refugees who have almost no hope otherwise.

"Most of them are children," Graham said. "About 70% of Syrian refugees are children. And they've fled with just the clothes on their back, they have nothing."

And it's not just Iraq and Syria where Samaritan's Purse has focused their attention. Kids in more than 150 countries have received over a hundred million boxes since 1993.

Samaritan's Purse is a Christian organization headed up by the son of one of the most famous Christian evangelists in the country, Billy Graham.

Sometimes these packages can have more than just short-term effects.

Franklin Graham told the story of then seven-year-old Tyler Wolfe who in the year 2000 sent a Christmas shoebox gift to a child named Joana Marchan in the Philippines. With the power of the internet and a few long plane rides over a decade later, the two eventually connected in-person and married in October.
(CNN) -- In-form England striker Wayne Rooney scored the opening two goals as Manchester United crushed AC Milan 4-0 to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League.

Park Ji-sung and Darren Fletcher were also on target for the English Premier League champions as United secured a convincing 7-2 aggregate success.

All the talk beforehand was of Milan midfielder David Beckham's return to Old Trafford for the first time since United sold him to Real Madrid in 2003.

And the England star was given an emotional reception by the United fans when he came on as a second-half substitute.

However, Milan were already 3-0 behind when Beckham was introduced by Milan coach Leonardo and, despite some nice touches and a couple of dangerous crosses, was powerless to help Milan back into the match.

Rooney took his personal tally for the season to 30 with goals either side of half-time.

The opener came in the 13th minute when Rooney rose between two Milan defenders to head home a Gary Neville right-wing cross.

And the second came just 54 seconds after the break when Rooney broke clear through the middle to get a decisive touch to Nani's superb cross with the outside of his foot.

The tie was firmly killed off when Korean Park finished off a Paul Scholes pass and the scoring was completed when Darren Fletcher converted at the far post with two minutes remaining.

"It was a disappointing night because we lost the game but returning here is always special," Beckham told ITV Sport.

"It was unbelievable. I have to say thank you. It was really incredible. It was nice to be back, a disappointing night but nice to be back."
(CNN) -- Welcome to the new cool. The dreadlocks. The headphones. The beats. The fist-bumping.

Forget pumped up, chiseled athletes focused on nothing more than winning.

If snowboarders were the Olympics' introduction to a younger, hipper, "slacker" generation of competitors, the next wave of adrenaline junkies has taken it back to the new old school.

"It's like playing," Jamie Anderson said after winning gold in inaugural women's slopestyle snowboarding event in Sochi.

"We're pretty much snowboarding on a playground up there."

Slopestyle, which also has a ski discipline, is one of 12 new categories at 2014 Winter Games -- eight of which have their origins in extreme sports.

It's part of the International Olympic Committee's bid to attract younger audiences, a mission shared by its broadcast and advertising partners.

Short-track speed skating was added in 1992, and snowboarding came six years later.

But forget the idea of 10,000 hours of repetitive practice -- as Anderson says, these new sports are all about playing.

All playgrounds have their own vocabulary, and expressions like "stoked," "corked" and "stalefish" are rapidly becoming part of the sporting lexicon.

As is the idea of fun, which the winner of the men's slopestyle skiing event, Anderson's fellow American Joss Christensen, was keen to reference.

"I didn't try to put any more pressure on myself, I just tried to ski a normal contest and just do my best and have fun with it. I thought it worked out," said the 22-year-old in trademark understatement.

His comments underplayed the reality that the U.S. team annihilated the competition, claiming all three men's medals to end Canada's monopoly of freestyle golds at these Games.

Christensen had never won a major competition, and only qualified for the Olympics two weeks ago.

"I am shocked," he conceded. "I am stoked to be up here with my friends. America, we did it."

With Gus Kenworthy and Nick Goepper winning silver and bronze, it was a historic moment -- the U.S. had previously achieved such a clean sweep of medals on just two occasions: the 2002 men's halfpipe snowboard competition, and the 1956 men's individual figure skating singles.

But there was a serious undertone for Christensen, who has been mourning the loss of his father last year.

"I hope I made my father proud," he said.

"Through all the injuries I've had, he's always supported me and never said stop. I hope he's looking down and smiling. Did it for him."

As part of the slopestyle "playground" there is a "kiss and cry" area, where the competitors wait to see their results.

Not that there was any signs of tears at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park on Thursday. All the competitors look relaxed as if they were hanging out with their friends on the slopes of their backyard ski resort -- which is not so far-fetched, given they train together and meet at events several times a month.

The glory and seriousness of the Olympics seems something of a culture shock to these new Olympians. Their main event, the X Games, is all about showing off new tricks in fairly relaxed, showbiz atmosphere.

And it's not just spectators and television viewers who have been impressed by their performances.

"It looks very spectacular," IOC president Thomas Bach told reporters after Christensen's win. "I just met the three medalists and they are cool guys."

"They found it (the competition) cool and now they wait for the party. When you win you have the party."

Perhaps the Winter Olympics' new breed is best encapsulated by Henrik Harlaut. The 22-year-old Swede might not have made it up on the podium, but he definitely garnered plenty of attention with his very, very low-cut pants -- which, by the end of his run, revealed much of his colorful underwear.

Along with the incredible tricks, style is a big part of these competitions.

"I don't think skiing with my ski pants so low is an issue," Harlaut insisted.

"I have been skiing like this for 10 years now. It is my style and has been for a while. I feel really comfortable."

Not everyone has been impressed by the tricks and a more relaxed of sporting competition

"I think the president of the IOC should be Johnny Knoxville, because basically, this stuff is just 'Jackass' stuff that they invented and called Olympic sports," commentator Bob Costas said on NBC said before the Games began, referring to the comedic daredevil who was known for crashing into things.

That's not a view shared by the U.S. Olympic Committee, which has specifically targeted invested in these new sports, primarily because they deliver medals for America.

"We've been able to really customize and drill down where we can have the greatest impact," Alan Ashley, the USOC's chief of sport performance, told the Washington Post.

"I'd like to try to get as many athletes as possible opportunities to become Olympians, then become successful Olympians as well."

So behind the cool exterior, there is some bottom-line accounting going on.
This one was big but it's not the Big One.

An 8.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of northern Chile Tuesday night, triggering small landslides, setting off a tsunami and killing at least five people.

But geologists say an even larger quake in the region is lurking.

"This magnitude 8.2 is not the large earthquake that we were expecting in this area," said Mark Simons, a geophysicist at Caltech in Pasadena, California. "We're expecting a potentially even larger earthquake."

It could be tomorrow. Or it could be 50 years.

"We do not know when it's going to occur," he said.

Here's why:

Chile sits on an arc of volcanos and fault lines circling the Pacific Ocean known as the "Ring of Fire." This area sees frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

The country itself has seen no shortage of seismic activity in recent years.

Since 1973, Chile has had more than a dozen quakes of magnitude-7.0 and above.

Powerful earthquake strikes off Chile, triggers tsunami

In 2010, about 500 people died when an 8.8-magnitude earthquake hit. That quake was so violent, it moved one whole city about 10 feet west.

Simons says Tuesday's quake is of interest because the fault line along Chile's coast has constantly shifted during the last 140 years.

In recent weeks, this area has seen a cluster of activity-- something like 50 to 100 smaller quakes.

Then, late last month, a 6.7 and a 6.1 magnitude quake struck.

When quakes happen, the surface ruptures. The two sides of the fault slip past each other.

But the area to the north and south of Tuesday's quake "did not rupture in this event," Simons said. And it's "still an area that hasn't ruptured in 140-odd years."

Given that it's an area of frequent quakes, and frequent ruptures, it may only be a matter of time.

"We expect another 8.8-8.9 earthquake here sometime in the future," Simons said.

The good news? "It may not occur for many, many years."

The place where two earthquakes hit every hour
(CNN) -- Argentina's David Nalbandian and Eduardo Schwank kept Argentina's Davis Cup dreams alive after they thrashed Spain's Feliciano Lopez and Fernando Verdasco in the doubles rubber 6-4 6-2 6-3 in Seville on Saturday.

Trailing 2-0 after Friday's singles matches, Argentina had to win Saturday's only rubber to stop Spain from claiming their fifth win in the competition.

Fighting Ferrer give Spain commanding lead

Nalbandian and Schwank never looked in any trouble throughout the match, breaking in the fifth game of the first set before racing into a 4-0 lead in the second.

Spain's only two chances to break came in the sixth game of the third set but both times Nalbandian denied them.

Argentina now trail Spain 2-1. If they win both singles rubbers on Sunday they will become the first team in 72 years to win the David Cup from 2-0 down.

Juan Martin Del Potro will face Rafael Nadal in the first singles match while Nalbadian is scheduled to face David Ferrer.
Cairo (CNN) -- Omar Suleiman, the Egyptian vice president under Hosni Mubarak who announced the president's resignation to the world, has died in a U.S. hospital at age 76, officials said Thursday.

A family member said the former spy chief had "water on his lungs and suffered heart problems that led to his death after his health deteriorated in the past three weeks."

He had traveled to Germany for medical reasons before for traveling Monday to a medical center in Cleveland.

Suleiman died early Thursday with his family at his side at the Cleveland Clinic, which announced that his death was due to "complications from amyloidosis, a disease that affects multiple organs including the heart and kidneys."

His body was to arrive Friday morning in Egypt and his funeral was to be held after prayers, relatives said.

Head of Egypt's powerful intelligence services, Suleiman also served as vice president under Mubarak before his ouster.

In a somber one-minute television announcement in February 2011, Suleiman announced that Mubarak had resigned his post as president and declared that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces would run the country's affairs.

Timeline: Unrest in Egypt

The announcement followed an 18-day popular uprising in Egypt that saw tens of thousands take to the streets to demand Mubarak's ouster.

Suleiman most recently made headlines when he entered the race for Egypt's first democratically elected president in the eleventh hour and then failed to gather enough signatures required to be on the ballot.

He was disqualified from the election by a panel that included members connected to the Mubarak regime, which suggested that his elimination from the presidential race was not politically motivated.

Suleiman had headed Egypt's intelligence since 1993, maintained close CIA ties and was often criticized by rights groups for his heavy-handed approach with suspected militants.

Born into poverty in the Egyptian town of Qena, he enrolled in the country's prestigious military academy and was decorated for his performance in the wars against Israel in 1967 and 1973.

In June 1995, both Suleiman and Mubarak survived an assassination attempt during an African summit in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.

Washington (CNN) -- As speaker of the House, John Boehner faced battles on two fronts during his first term: fights with President Barack Obama on a series of high-profile fiscal issues, and internal skirmishes with conservative rank-and-file Republicans who openly defied him because they didn't think he was doing enough to cut spending.

And as Obama takes the oath of office and begins to address the challenges of his second term, his on-again, off-again negotiating counterpart faces his own set of challenges in the coming weeks.

Days after the bruising fight at the end of 2012 to avert the fiscal cliff that divided the House GOP conference -- as well as his own leadership team -- a dozen House Republicans broke with Boehner by not supporting him for speaker in the public vote on the House floor. Boehner was reelected with the vast majority of his conference sticking with him, but the episode demonstrated his weakened position and raised questions about whether he could lead his members in new fights ahead.

House Republicans pledge to back Boehner

But after a three-day retreat of all House Republicans last week at a resort in Williamsburg, Virginia, GOP members appear to be regrouping and putting the messy squabbles behind them. Leaders are shifting their strategy away from one of aggressive confrontation to giving some ground to show they can govern.

Boehner succeeded at tamping down the public splits among House Republicans -- at least for now -- and adjusted the expectations for his members. Two years ago, a large freshmen class backed by the tea party handed Boehner the gavel as speaker. This group pushed for massive spending cuts and changes to how the government operates. But the dysfunction and gridlock after those demands hit a wall with a majority Democrat Senate and Obama, sending Congress' approval ratings plummeting.

Polls show the GOP got the bulk of the blame. For Boehner, just getting the bare minimum done on Capitol Hill turned into a herculean task.

Congress faces a trio of major legislative battles in the first 90 days of 2013 -- the need to raise the debt ceiling as early as mid-February, automatic spending cuts kicking in at the beginning of March, and another threat of a government shutdown at the end of March. But instead of arguing as they have -- that their majority in the House is a mandate from voters not to compromise -- GOP leaders decided to start the year taking smaller steps to achieve their goals.

House Republicans to vote on three-month debt ceiling extension

At the retreat, Boehner tapped former 2012 GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, popular among conservative ranks, to walk members through the big fights ahead.

GOP faces realities of divided government

Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, said the GOP was still determined to force Congress to take up major deficit-reduction measures, but summed up his message to reporters after a session with all House Republicans.

"We also have to recognize the realities of divided government that we have," he said.

Acknowledging that another contentious face-off with the White House over the debt limit wasn't likely to end well for them, Boehner worked with a small group of members that included Ryan and other leading conservatives to come up with a plan to postpone that fight.

As the retreat ended Friday, House GOP leaders announced the House would vote next week on a bill to extend the nation's borrowing authority for another three months. But their plan removed a hardline demand for spending cuts that House Republicans previously insisted had to be attached to any measure to increase the debt ceiling.

That so called "Boehner rule" -- any increase in the debt limit had to be accompanied by spending cuts of the same size -- was only going to run into another public clash with the White House.

Instead, their legislation conditions the increase in the debt limit on a requirement that the Senate pass a budget -- something conservatives complain the upper chamber has failed to do the past four years. And their proposal also includes a provision that says if Congress doesn't pass a budget by the mid-April deadline, its members won't get paid.

House GOP aides maintain that the Boehner rule is still in place as they negotiate measures down the line, but taking it out of the mix for now was a major acknowledgment that the fight had become unwinnable.

South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, one of the dozen House Republicans who didn't vote to reelect Boehner speaker, told reporters after the retreat that he agreed it was better to push off the most contentious battle.

"Why wouldn't we deal with the smaller ones first, maybe build up a little momentum, build up a little credibility -- not only with the credit markets but also with the folks back home -- that we can actually deal with these things," Mulvaney said, adding, "I think it makes perfect sense. It's a rational, reasonable thing to do."

Another conservative member, Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana, who noted that he's never voted for a debt-ceiling increase, said he supported the approach. He also pointed out that the move reflected a commitment by Boehner to avoid one-on-one-negotiations with the president on these issues in the future, and instead chart a course internally first.

Boehner puts onus on Obama

"I don't see the divisions now that maybe we've seen in the past [among Republicans] and I think the process has improved," Fleming said.

Different tone coming out of GOP retreat

The tone coming out of the retreat signals that leaders convinced many of those pushing for broader changes that they need to rethink how realistic it is to send proposals out of the House only to hit a wall in the Senate.

But the cease-fire between conservatives and Boehner may not last long.

Mulvaney noted that most of the newly elected House Republicans backed his effort to force Congress to offset the disaster aid package for victims of Superstorm Sandy -- a departure from congressional precedent to give immediate emergency money to states without any strings. Although that proposal failed, Mulvaney argued the strong support for it was evidence that conservatives would have more power internally to pressure leaders.

Christie: 'Shame on Congress' for not voting on Sandy aid

"Maybe the freshmen might be a little more fiscally conservative than people expect them to be," Mulvaney said.

Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who heads the Republican Study Committee, a group of fiscal conservatives, was part of the group Boehner tapped, along with Ryan, to devise the three-month debt-ceiling extension.

While he helped GOP leaders generate buy-in from conservatives for moving away from their insistence for spending cuts now, Scalise summed up his role going forward: "I need to pull our leadership to the right."

It's unclear how the debt-ceiling battle will play out. Some Democrats saw the move to as encouraging, but argue revisiting the issue in three months causes instability for financial markets. And House Democrats called the requirement for Congress to pass a budget a "gimmick."

Fiscal debates will again dominate Congress' agenda for early 2013, but other contentious battles such as immigration reform will also split House Republicans and could test Boehner's hold on the speaker's gavel.

After the shootings at an elementary school in Connecticut in December that killed 20 children and six adults, Obama has urged Congress to make legislation with new restrictions on guns and ammunition a top priority. Boehner told House Republicans at the retreat he'll look at what the administration is proposing, but he doesn't plan for the House to take any action until the Senate passes something, and that could be an uphill battle.

The GOP retreat also featured a panel with pollsters who showed internal numbers highlighting the party's deficit of support among women and minorities. Both Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and former Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortuno urged members to step up efforts to show it welcomes those groups.

Attracting minority voters a key GOP goal

Rep. Greg Walden, who runs the House GOP 2014 campaign operation to retain and expand their majority, told reporters he tapped Rep. Jamie Herrera Beutler, the youngest female House member and a Hispanic, to help with outreach.

But Walden admitted Republicans need to step up that effort as the Hispanic community was increasing its voting numbers.

"We recognize that Republicans have good answers, we just have bad communications in many cases."
(CNN) -- Chen Guangcheng, activist

Q: Why did you change your mind about staying in China?

A: I think it's time for me to make such a choice.

Q: Why?

A: For safety.

Q: Fear for your life or your family's?

A: Both.

Chinese activist tells CNN: 'We are in danger'

Q: What would happen if you stay in China?

A: Anything could happen.

Q: U.S. officials said you looked optimistic when you walked out of the embassy, what happened?

A: At the time I didn't have a lot of information. I wasn't allowed to call my friends from inside the embassy. I couldn't keep up with news so I didn't know a lot of things that were happening.

Q: What prompted your change of heart?

A: The embassy kept lobbying me to leave and promised to have people stay with me in the hospital. But this afternoon as soon as I checked into the hospital room, I noticed they were all gone.

Q: Has the U.S. disappointed you?

A: I'm very disappointed at the U.S. government.

Q: Why?

A: I don't think (U.S. officials) protected human rights in this case.

Q: What would you say to U.S. President Obama?

A: I would like to say to (President Obama): Please do everything you can to get our whole family out.

Q: Is this your most urgent wish?

A: That's right.

Q: What has your wife told you after you escaped?

A: (My wife) was tied to a chair by police for two days. Then they carried sticks to our home, threatening to beat her to death. Now they have moved into the house -- eating at our table and using our stuff. Our home is teeming with security -- on the roof and in the yard. They have installed seven surveillance cameras inside the house and built electric fences around the yard.

Q: What did officials tell her if you didn't leave the embassy?

A: They said they would send her back (to Shandong) and people there would beat her.

Q: If you stay in China, is there no future?

A: I tend to think so.

Q: You learned most information in the hospital after you left the embassy?

A: Yes, most of it.

Q: Are your wife and kids with you?

A: Yes. I just switched my cell phone back on. For a while, I couldn't make or receive calls. Now I can receive calls but still can't dial out. I feel my rights are already being violated.

Q: Is it true no one from the embassy picked up your calls?

A: Yes. I called two embassy people numerous times.

Q: What do you want to say to the U.S. government?

A: I want them to protect human rights through concrete actions. We are in danger. If you can talk to Hillary (Clinton), I hope she can help my whole family leave China.

Q: As soon as possible?

A: Yes, as soon as possible.

Q: The whole world is watching you -- how do you feel about this?

A: I feel very grateful. I feel they are sincere in their concern, not just for show.

Q: Do you feel you were lied to by the embassy?

A: I feel a little like that.

Q: What has this ordeal taught you?

A: I feel everyone focuses too much on their self-interest at the expense of their credibility.

Q: You're both still up at 3 a.m. -- feeling anxious?

A: Yes, we feel a lot of anxiety.... I told the embassy I would like to talk to Rep. Smith (Congressman Chris Smith) but they somehow never managed to arrange it. I feel a little puzzled.

Yuan Weijing, Chen Guangcheng's wife

Q: What do you want right now?

A: After seeing the reality, we both want to leave this place with our kids as soon as possible. It's very dangerous for us.

Q: Has the situation gotten worse since his escape?

A: Yes, worse.

Q: What happened to you after he escaped -- where is his mother?

A: She's still back home and others have moved in. It used to be plainclothes security hired locally but now it's all policemen. They've threatened to cut our power. They are also digging something outside our yard. It seems that they'll install something there.

Q: What happened when they took you into custody after his escape?

A: They wanted to know how exactly he escaped. Guangcheng is blind and we hired so many guards, how did we lose him and what exactly would he do once he was out?

Q: Is China the kind of country you want to bring your children up?

A: After Guangcheng got out, the government was persuading me to stay here. But they were also tightening their grip on me. I became really worried. If they ever get us back home, they would put us in an iron cage.

Q: What would you say to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton?

A: I know Sino-U.S. relations encompass many issues and they have to consider many things. But the reality about my family is that our lives are in obvious danger. If we stay here or get sent back to Shandong, our lives would be at stake. Under such circumstances, I hope the U.S. government will protect us and help us leave China based on its value of protecting human rights.

Q: Are you prepared for not being allowed back?

A: We are prepared because our current situation is very dangerous... They made many promises. But right now, we can't even freely use our phone. I can't even freely walk out of the hospital. Friends can't visit us. It just proves that our human rights are not being protected.

Q: Are there people watching you at the hospital?

A: They have security guards here.

Q: Have the embassy people have left?

A: Yes. They promised to stay here with Guangcheng -- that would give us some sense of security. But we haven't seen anyone since we checked into this hospital room. I was actually persuading Guangcheng to seek treatment in a hospital -- but I didn't know the embassy (people) were lobbying him to leave (the embassy).
(CNN) -- It's called a document dump.

In this case, 175 pages of contractors' internal updates on the beleaguered HealthCare.gov website were blasted out Wednesday night by Rep. Darryl Issa's Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

You can read it all online. But we read it so you don't have to, poring through the jargony, technical documents ("Pre Prod is now IMP1A"), to give you another option -- the five things you need to know:

Related: Obamacare launch may have been worse than first reported

1. Low-tech options failed too

In the first weeks of the Obamacare sign-up, the two low-tech options for Americans -- the call center and paper applications -- struggled and sometimes froze. An October 8 entry about the number of paper forms turned in at that point simply said "500 applications ... but can't process any because of log-in and other issues." By October 16, some 3,000 paper applications were in the processing center but only "81 have been successfully entered."

A tough decision emerged: Should navigators -- those who help people sign up -- recommend that folks leave the slow website and send in a paper form? Or would that matter? Contractors wrote they were waiting on the Department of Health and Human Services to decide. By October 15, contractors were recommending the paper applications, documents show.

Meanwhile, the call center was getting high marks for low wait times and professional operators, but an October 3 note reads: "50% of call center calls have issues." The problem was with a technical interface to check people's identities. Four days later, a more basic issue: "Our call center reps can't see their screens," wrote an unnamed consultant.

In response, the Department of Health and Human Services told CNN that these are contractor notes that only depict the state of the website in its first days. "We have made significant progress," said HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters.

2. It's all about the 834s

In a document full of figures and consultant-speak, one number stands out: 834. That's the code for the final step in the HealthCare.gov process, when all the data entered is sent to the insurance company a user has chosen. It sets up the actual insurance policy and hands off responsibility to the company or organization running that plan.

But from the start, that data was not transferring correctly. "834 issue - Raised here as well - issuers not receiving 834s that they should be getting," a contractor wrote on October 3. At one point no one could track whether the final 834 data entered by individuals was actually the same as the 834 data going out to insurers.

3. A small group of contractors was key

Reading these pages feels almost voyeuristic. It's a bit like hovering in the back of the main conference room for HealthCare.gov. Problems are listed, tasks to respond to are handed out crisply and clearly.

And from the back of the room, you notice something. Those tasks go to a small core group of top coordinators, representing different companies and pieces of the process. The documents refer to those generally on a first-name basis, but not that many names appear. Two dozen or so people -- Carlos, Abigail, Joy, Beth, Milan, Sandeep, John, Meg at CGI, Devon, Lourdes, Gina and others -- had a lot of work on their plates.

4. The initial technical issues were many and massive

On the first day, there was a big problem that we hadn't heard about before. "There was a fix regarding residency for Medicaid and CHIP that was not fixed correctly and is denying ... 90% of people based on residency," the war room notes from the day read.

As the documents move on and issues are tackled one by one, sweeping problems continue to appear.

October 9: "A new problem in the system has been identified: for about 30% of the 70,000 applicants, the system has skipped applicants through 'events' that are required to complete the application." In other words, nearly a third of applicants couldn't fill out the form, because the website was skipping "events" or entries they needed to make.

Related: Obama 'can't go back' and change Obamacare vow

5. The devil was really in the details

While big-picture problems erupted with HealthCare.gov, hundreds of smaller but still urgent issues were flying from the volcano as well.

A few examples:

• At one point, a software problem hit every application from a married couple. The program recorded each spouse as "unmarried," not just an identity issue but a major data issue for insurers.

• For weeks, programmers fought a problem that initially blocked and later snagged naturalized citizens who needed verification from the Department of Homeland Security.

• Contractors spent almost two weeks sorting out how to handle weight loss surgery and whether insurance companies need to include that in all policies.

• In mid-October, the tool to estimate potential premiums was misreading ages, recording each person as having an age range, rather than a definite age. That was affecting the tool and its results, potentially for almost everyone.

CNN's Z. Byron Wolf and Tom Cohen contributed to this story.
(CNN) -- With 17 Grammy awards, $75 million in world record sales and a fourth world tour underway, Beyonce is one of the world's biggest names in show business.

From performances at this year's Superbowl to the presidential inauguration, few celebrities have the success, drive and international cachet of the high profile soulstress.

But she doesn't just dominate the music charts and the stage ... Beyonce is a global brand and works hard to keep it that way.

Her name appears everywhere from fashion labels to fragrance bottles and Pepsi commercials. On the heels of her own HBO documentary 'Life Is But A Dream', she and husband Jay-Z were also named the pop music industry's first billionaire couple.

Watch: How Beyonce became businesswoman

Forbes also ranked Beyonce as the 32nd most powerful woman in the world last year, estimating her earnings at $40 million, a figure likely to grow as she reaps the rewards from her Mrs Carter Show World Tour and lucrative H&M campaign.

Through a carefully-managed image, the 31-year-old star shows she can do it all by portraying herself as a sexy performer, an astute businesswoman, a dutiful wife and loving mother and a girl-next-door from Texas.

"Beyonce inspires others to dream because she is always reminding us that she was just a young girl from Houston, Texas, who had a dream to be a performer, and look at her now," says Cori Murray, entertainment editor of Essence Magazine.

"She had a dream, she envisioned it. Hard work, determination, and this is the result," sums up Gail Mitchell, senior editor at Billboard Magazine.

Family ties

The daughter of a hairdresser and an IBM marketing executive, Beyonce took to the stage early. She began performing with a girl band -- later known as Destiny's Child - at the age of eight, managed by her father Matthew Knowles and his marketing expertise.

It took some years before Destiny's Child made their major label breakthrough by signing with Columbia Records in 1999 with the album "The Writing's On The Wall" and two number one singles "Bills, Bills, Bills" and "Say My Name."

Matthew Knowles left his job at IBM and remained Beyonce's manager into her solo career -- which began in 2003 with her album "Dangerously In Love" -- until 2011 when the pair parted ways.

"It was hard for me to let her go -- it was hard for both of us to let each other go," her father later told The Sun newspaper. "This was not a normal ending of a business agreement. This was a dad and a daughter and it was incredibly painful and it had some difficulties."

Aside from her music, she has mastered the art of celebrity endorsements over the years by striking lucrative deals with Pepsi and L'Oreal and launching fragrances with Tommy Hilfiger.

Savvy sponsorship deals

Sealing a $50 million multi-year deal with Pepsi in December, the partnership includes commercials and print ads as well as a fund to support the singer's chosen creative projects. Far from featuring old tunes as many ads do, Beyonce's latest Pepsi commercial previews a new song "Grown Woman," which will feature on her forthcoming album.

"Beyonce's influence in pop culture [is] not just in the music industry, but also in the beauty industry and in fashion," says fashion stylist June Ambrose. "She has become the poster child in terms of her brand being so well recognized."

The singer and her mother Tina Knowles run a fashion label House of Dereon, named after the star's seamstress grandmother.

She stays involved at every stage of her campaigns, giving her control over her own brand.

"This is not a woman who just lends her name to it and then she is off to her yacht," says Murray of Essence Magazine.

The control extends to her own image. In her current world tour, she refused to accredit press photographers and banned all but authorized pictures from her own entertainment company, according to several media reports.

Career evolution

Beyonce is executive producer of her own HBO documentary "Life Is But A Dream" in which she tells her story through her own eyes. The film is filled with home movie clips from her childhood in Houston to her show preparations and her life with Jay-Z and 15-month-old daughter Blue Ivy.

From starring in her own documentary to films such as "Dreamgirls," "Cadillac Records" and "The Fighting Temptations," the songstress has kept her name in lights by contributing to movie soundtracks, most recently film director Baz Luhrmann's "The Great Gatsby."

Luhrmann wrote in Time Magazine as it named Beyonce among the world's 100 most influential people in 2013: "She and Jay Z are the royal couple of culture, and she is the queen bee.

Power networking

"She's gone beyond being a popular singer, even beyond being a pop-cultural icon ... Right now, she is the heir-apparent diva of the USA, the reigning national voice."

From granting Oprah an exclusive OWN interview to supporting President Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, Beyonce's proven her influence extends well beyond her voice by making friends in high places.

In return, Obama called the singer "a role model for his daughters" at an election fundraiser hosted by the power couple and she performed the national anthem at his second inauguration.

While stellar performances and lucrative endorsement deals far from guarantee a star's long term future in the fickle world of entertainment, one thing is for certain --Beyonce has proven she is a survivor.
An architect of the Obama administration's "reset" policy with Russia says he will step down as the American ambassador to the country later this month.

Michael McFaul, U.S. ambassador to Russia since January 2012, announced Tuesday he'll leave the post shortly after the Winter Olympics conclude in the southern Russian resort town of Sochi.

McFaul has been a controversial figure in Russia, with some state-run media viewing him with suspicion for his outspoken support of pro-democracy groups. But in his online journal, McFaul said Tuesday that he would miss the job, stressing he was leaving for family considerations.

McFaul said his wife and two sons moved back to California last summer because his oldest son wanted to be home for the last few years of high school.

"We tried to make a 9,000 kilometer commute work for our family.  But after seven months of separation, I simply need to be with my family again," McFaul wrote.

"I will leave Russia reluctantly," he said. "I love this job. It is a tremendous honor to represent my country here. I will miss interacting with my partners in the Russian government and with Russians from all sectors of society."

As a Stanford University political science professor, McFaul became one of the best-known American experts on Russia.  After advising then-Sen. Barack Obama on Russia during the 2008 presidential campaign, McFaul took a leave from Stanford to become senior director for Russia and Eurasian affairs at the National Security Council.

He helped develop the U.S. "reset" policy with Russia, after which the countries signed the New START arms control deal and agreed on a  transit treaty allowing the United States and NATO to use a route through Russia into Afghanistan.

On his arrival in Moscow as ambassador in 2012, he got a rough reception from government-controlled media. An analyst on a government network said McFaul was a "specialist purely in the promotion of democracy" and suggested his agenda was dedicated to supporting opposition leaders in the country.

That criticism came as protesters in Moscow were rallying against then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who was running again for president. Putin, who went on to win the presidency, accused the U.S. State Department of stirring things up.

McFaul's ambassadorship came at a time of strained relations between the two countries, with quarrels over, among other things, Syria's civil war and the arrival in Moscow of admitted National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.

U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said Tuesday that President Obama "is deeply grateful for Ambassador McFaul's extraordinary service over the last five years."

"From the White House to Spaso House (the U.S. Embassy in Moscow), Mike helped shape policies that advanced America's interest -- from the New START treaty, to resupplying our troops in Afghanistan; from sustaining U.S.-Russian cooperation on negotiations with Iran, to deepening trade and commercial ties," Rhodes said.

CNN first learned of McFaul's planned departure on Twitter.
(CNN) -- A woman in California delivered what may be the nation's second live-born set of octuplets on Monday morning, surprising doctors who expected seven babies.

The first three to seven days will be critical for the infants, Dr. Mandhir Gupta said.

The six boys and two girls -- ranging in weight from 1 pound 8 ounces to 3 pounds 4 ounces -- were generally doing well in incubators following their Caesarean-section delivery at Kaiser Permanente hospital in Bellflower, California, doctors said.

Three of the babies need breathing assistance, but otherwise the eight don't appear to have serious problems, doctors said at a news conference Monday evening.

"It was a truly amazing delivery," said Dr. Karen Maples, chief of the hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department.

Doctors initially believed the mother -- whom they did not identify -- was pregnant with seven fetuses. The woman was 23 weeks pregnant when she was hospitalized seven weeks ago and ordered to bed rest.  Watch doctors explain what happened »

Over a seven-week period, a team of 46 physicians, nurses and other staff prepared for the births. When they started the delivery Monday -- more than nine weeks before the babies would be full term -- they were in for a surprise.

"After we got to Baby G, we were surprised by the discovery of a Baby H," Maples said.

Getting the number correct with ultrasounds before delivery is difficult with so many babies, said Dr. Harold Henry, the hospital's chief of fetal medicine.

"It is quite easy to miss a baby when you're expecting seven," Henry said.

The hospital said the woman didn't want her personal information released to the news media, and it would not answer questions about whether she'd had  fertility treatments.

Preliminary research indicates this is the second set of live-born octuplets in the United States, according to the hospital.

Eight babies believed to be the United States' first set of live octuplets were born in Houston, Texas, in 1998. One of the infants died days after birth. The seven other siblings recently celebrated their 10th birthday, the Houston Chronicle reported last month.

The first three to seven days will be critical for the California babies, said Dr. Mandhir Gupta, one of the doctors at the news conference. The infants could be in incubators for six to eight weeks and in the hospital for 10 weeks, Gupta said.

The mother is doing "very well" after the deliveries, which took about five minutes, Gupta said.

"She is very excited that she [has] all these babies and that the babies are looking good so far," Gupta said.
Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf on Sunday met with Shiites in Quetta who are protesting the bombing deaths of 97 people last week, Pakistani media reported.

Ashraf addressed protestors who are taking part in a sit-in and have lined up the bodies of bombing victims at major intersections. He said he would meet one of the two major demands of the group, tossing out the provincial government and putting a governor in charge.

However, Ashraf said he wouldn't implement military rule in the city but would leave it up to the governor to ask for more help -- if needed -- from paramilitary forces to try to quell the violence.

It was unclear when the sit-in would end, as leaders of the protest said they will take a wait-and-see approach to the change in government.

Local Shiites have also refused to bury most of the victims after a series of bombings rocked Quetta on Thursday, police official Wazir Khan Nasir said.

Relatives of the deceased have sat beside the bodies in freezing temperatures over the past three days. Symbolic protests occurred in other cities, including Islamabad.

Earlier, Ashraf also condemned the blasts in Quetta.

"The prime minister, while expressing his heartfelt condolences and sympathies with the bereaved families, reiterated the government's resolve to stamp out the menace of militancy and terrorism from the country in its all shapes and manifestations," said a statement from his office.

Not burying dead bodies immediately after death is taboo in Islam. The soul of the body is not considered to be at rest until the body is in the ground.

Quetta is the capital of Balochistan province, an area regularly plagued by violence. In addition to sectarian attacks on Shiites, unrest in the province is believed to be fomented by several insurgent groups, including the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army and the Pakistani Taliban.

Although Balochistan is the largest province in Pakistan geographically, analysts and some locals have criticized the federal government for neglecting it, leading to instability.

The Shiite community has repeatedly asked for more protection but to no avail.

Last week's string of attacks was the deadliest so far against the minority Shiite community, which has been targeted repeatedly in the past by groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a banned Sunni militant group.

The deadliest explosions were two suicide bombings in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood known as Alamdar Road.

One blast brought police, rescue workers and journalists rushing to the scene. It was swiftly followed by another explosion -- set off by a man sitting in a car with more than 100 kilograms of explosives -- that hit many of those responding to the initial attack.

The double bombing, described by police as one of the worst attacks on the Shiite minority, killed 85 people and wounded about 150.

Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the Alamdar Road attacks.

Shiites, a minority sect in mainly Sunni Muslim Pakistan, face persecution from extremists. Last month, more than 20 Shiite pilgrims were killed when a car bomb detonated near the buses they were traveling in.

Mir Zubair Mehmood, a Quetta police official, said the Alamdar attacks were motivated by Sunni and Shiite sectarian differences.

Another blast in Quetta on Thursday struck a security checkpoint in a busy market, authorities said. A bomb planted in a car detonated as security forces entered the area, killing 12 people and wounding 45, according Nasir, the police spokesman. Nasir blamed the attack on Baloch insurgents.

A fourth bomb went off by the side of the road leading to the city's airport, wounding three.

(CNN) -- A new judge was tapped Thursday to preside over the case of George Zimmerman after the original judge was forced to step down.

Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester will be replaced by Judge Debra Nelson, who was appointed to the bench in 1999.

The move came one day after a Florida appeals court granted Zimmerman's request for a new judge, saying the original judge's remarks put Zimmerman in reasonable fear of an unfair trial.

Zimmerman, 28, is charged with second-degree murder in the February 26 shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin.

His attorneys wanted Lester removed, saying language he used in a bail order disparaged their client's character and held over his head the threat of future criminal proceedings.

The Fifth District Court of Appeal agreed, and Lester was forced to disqualify himself.

Lester revoked Zimmerman's original $150,000 bond after learning Zimmerman and his wife, Shellie, failed to disclose more than $100,000 in donations from the public.

The judge then set a new bail of $1 million in July, and it was the language in that bail order that Zimmerman and his lawyers took issue with.

The court agreed with Zimmerman's attorneys that Lester "made gratuitous, disparaging remarks about Mr. Zimmerman's character; advocated for Mr. Zimmerman to be prosecuted for additional crimes; offered a personal opinion about the evidence for the prosecution; continued to hold over Mr. Zimmerman's head the threat of future contempt proceedings, and ultimately set a bond at $1,000,000."

The appeals court also agreed that Lester's remarks "created reasonable fear in Mr. Zimmerman that the court is biased against him, and, as a result of this prejudice cannot receive a fair and impartial trial or hearing by the trial court."

In his July bail order, Lester wrote that "under any defnition, the defendant has flouted the system" and "tried to manipulate the system when he has been presented the opportunity to do so."

Lester also wrote that it was his "personal opinion" that Zimmerman intentionally gave false or misleading information in his bail application -- which is a felony -- and he suggested the possibility of future contempt proceedings.

"Holding this over Mr. Zimmerman creates a horrible chilling effect on this case, on the defense presentation, and cements Mr. Zimmerman's fear that he will not get a fair trial from the trial court," the appeals court wrote.

Zimmerman is free after posting the $1 million bond.

The former neighborhood watch captain has pleaded not guilty to the charges and said he shot the 17-year-old Martin in self-defense after Martin attacked him. Martin, who was unarmed, was walking through a gated neighborhood in Sanford, Florida, to his father's girlfriend's house when he was killed.

(CNN)  -- Felipe Massa had emergency surgery for a fractured skull after a freak crash in final qualifying for Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix.

Felipe Massa receives attention after his high-speed crash in Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying.

The Brazilian careered off at the 200kph Turn Four at the Hungaroring after being hit in the helmet by flying debris from rear wing of the Brawn GP of compatriot Rubens Barrichello.

2008 championship runner-up Massa was stunned and lost control as his Ferrari flew into a tire wall at high speed.

He was airlifted from the circuit to the AEK Hospital in Budapest and later underwent an emergency operation for the damage to his skull.

Massa is in intensive care on a respirator and remains under observation in an induced coma.

"The condition of the driver is serious, but stable," said a hospital spokesman.

After the frightening incident, Fernando Alonso claimed a surprising pole position in a chaotic end to Saturday's proceedings.

The Massa accident happened at the end of the second qualifying session and the action was suspended while officials checked for debris.

When the third and final qualifying session got underway it was Renault's Alonso clocked the fastest time of one minute 21.559 seconds.

Sebastian Vettel, second in the title race to Jenson Button, will start alongside Alonso on the front row, with his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber qualifying third.

Button was only eighth fastest with  Brawn GP teammate Barrichello 13th best, their worst qualifying performance of the season.

Button delayed his final qualifying run while his car was checked out after the earlier incident.

Reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton was fourth best for the improving McLaren team with Nico Rosberg in fifth for Williams.

With the electronic timing system lost to the pit lane and the television coverage, former two-time world champion Alonso was at first unaware he had taken his first pole of the season.

"We have made a good step forward and the car did improve in the last two races. We are more competitive, but I don't think we are as quick as these two guys (referring to Red Bull drivers Vettel and Webber)," he said.

"We will try to win, but being honest and realistic, our target is to get some good points," added the Spaniard.
(CNN) -- Ashlee Tomsche walked into the rec center with trepidation. Images of six-pack abs and neon sports bras from the Zumba infomercials she had watched flashed through her mind.

I'm going to look like a complete fool, she thought.

With her head down, she walked into the aerobics room and took a spot in the back. She was 21 and weighed 331 pounds.

Zumba is a Latin-inspired dance fitness class that blends booty shaking with international music and an intense calorie burn. Since the company launched in 2001, Zumba classes have spread to 14 million people in 150 countries, according to Zumba.com.

Tomsche's first class was hard. She had to stop several times to catch her breath. But she came back the next day. And then again the next. A year later, she had dropped 123 pounds, six dress sizes and more than 10 inches from her waist.

"It's just crazy," the Arkansas City, Kansas, resident says. "We're having too much fun."

Comfort food

Tomsche was an overweight child, but it wasn't until her best friend committed suicide when she was 16 that she started packing on the pounds.

"It really hit me hard, and I turned to food for comfort," she remembers. "It was always there."

She indulged in chips and ice cream, and drank soda by the gallon. She would eat an entire pizza by herself in one sitting. Every time she binged on junk food, she felt sick and swore she'd never do it again. But overeating had already taken its toll.

She didn't go out because she wasn't confident in her body. Instead she came home right after work to snack in front of the TV. Once in a while she would hit the gym to walk on the treadmill, but it bored her more than empowering her.

"I knew I needed to lose weight, but I never knew where to start," she says. "I would try something for a few months and give up."

Then she found Zumba.

Just dance

Instructor Maria Venegas remembers when Tomsche first tried her Zumba class. Tomsche wore baggy clothing and seemed unsure in her body.

"She would go and sit down about a third (of the) way into class," Venegas says. "But she would get right back up and continue to do what she could."

Venegas teaches seven Zumba classes a week in Arkansas City in addition to working as an office manager and professional photographer.

"I used to think it was my kids that kept me young," the single mother of two says. "But it has been my venture to become a Zumba instructor that has (been) the fountain of youth, for myself and many others."

Venegas creates her own routines, incorporating music from popular artists such as Michael Jackson and Ne-Yo into her classes. In a typical hourlong class, participants burn between 300 and 650 calories.

"Every class is always different," Tomsche says. "I'm addicted."

Tomsche loves Zumba so much she didn't even realize at first she was losing weight. But after four months, she had dropped 20 pounds and was getting compliments from her classmates. The attention encouraged her to keep going.

"Now (she) walks in with a big smile ... shoulders back and head up high," Venegas says.

Small town, big inspiration

Tomsche tracks her daily calories on the MyFitnessPal app and drinks protein shakes for breakfast. Giving up junk food has been hard, but she splurges occasionally on thin-crust pizza or Nutella on whole wheat waffles.

Tomsche does Zumba five to six times a week and tries to stay active the rest of the day. Her hard work has paid off -- she weighs 208 pounds and wears a size 14 pants.

"The simplest things in life have become easier," Tomsche wrote in a CNN iReport submission. "I don't feel like I can't breathe when I bend over to tie my shoes. I'm not out of breath when I walk up and down the halls at work, and even sleeping is easier since I don't have all that excess weight pressing down on me."

Venegas offered to do a professional photo shoot with Tomsche in January, and they posted the pictures online. Venegas' Zumba classes quickly filled up. She says Tomsche has inspired their small community.

Tomsche is just happy she's gotten her smile back.

"I never thought coming from a town of 12,000 (people) that I would be an inspiration for anyone," she says. "It's just given me so much confidence in myself."

Her advice for others who are struggling to lose weight? Find a workout that you love.

"It can be done," she says simply.

(CNN) -- Deep inside the South African Bushveld, a thunderous lion roar pierces the air as a parade of elephants ambles quietly through the flat terrain. Somewhere in the distance, a herd of leopards lurk in a dense riverine flora, while a group of giraffes stretch their long necks to munch on tree leaves.

In the middle of it all, Renias Mhlongo feels at home.

"That's where I was born, right under that tree," says Mhlongo, as he points out to a large ebony tree amidst the wildlife haven of South Africa's Kruger National Park.

Mhlongo, 49, is one of South Africa's very few senior trackers, honing the traditional skills of trailing animals in the Londolozi game reserve.

He works with fellow South African tracker and game ranger Alex van den Heever, trying to preserve the ancient tracking skills before being lost to modernity.

Over the years, the two men -- one black, one white -- have forged a strong friendship and working relationship that's taking them from tracking Londolozi's wildlife to traveling the world as international spokesmen for South Africa's bushveld.

"It's the connection to nature, to wilderness," says van den Heever of the deep bond he's created with Mhlongo.

"That's the first thing people relate to but then I think people know South Africa's history -- they know the troubles we've come through and when they see two guys, one black, one white, that have connected on such a deep level, they like that and that shows South Africa has a lot to offer," he adds.

Armed with uncanny intuition, Mhlongo spent all his childhood in the bush, herding and protecting his family's cattle from the lions, often on his own.

Growing up there, he got to listen to, read and understand the signs of the bush in a way that few can.

"When I grew up here, I sit quietly, listening to the different sound of animals, the sound of grasshoppers, the sound of the lion -- all that is part of my growing in nature because here, we don't have cell phones here, which makes me connect to the nature," says Mhlongo.

"If you come from a town, it's very difficult to spot things ... but I was born here and I use my passion to listen to everything, to try to spot something," he adds.

Today, Mhlongo and van den Heever use their vast knowledge and experience to pass on their Bushveld wisdom to younger generations. Together, they have started a tracker academy offering a year-long course in the skills Mhlongo learned as a youngster.

"It seeks to restore the indigenous knowledge that was once a part of our landscape," says van den Heever.

"There's only four or five authentic, genuine Bushman trackers left, so it (tracking) is dying and if you consider the formal qualifications, there are only 19 senior trackers in South Africa -- of which there are only five senior tracker evaluators and only three master trackers left," he adds. "So the bottom line is we're losing them and within 10 years if nothing is done we could have seen the last of the traditional trackers."

The two men also hold training workshops and travel the world to give talks and coach people on what they can learn from the South African bushveld, as well as encouraging conservation.

Mhlongo says he is passionate about teaching his valuable skills to aspiring trackers.

"It is very important to share the knowledge with other people, to give them the same skills like we have," says Mhlongo. "The tracking skill is something dying because no one wrote books on how to track animals, so we try to bring it up again."
Claudia Lacy says she can accept anything: even that her youngest son committed suicide -- if it's proven and explained to her.

However, she says, local and state investigators have done neither to support their theory that Lennon Lacy hanged himself one summer night.

"That's all I've ever asked for: what is due, owed rightfully to me and my family -- justice.  Prove to me what happened to my child," Lacy says.

She says she's long lost confidence in the Bladenboro Police Department and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation.

Now, the FBI is looking into Lacy's death and the local and state investigations that followed.

Without clear answers, the past few months without him have not been easy.

"I look for him and I don't see him.  I listen for him and I don't hear him," Lacy says.

The last time Lacy saw and heard her son was August 28.  Lennon, 17, played the lineman position for the West Bladen High School Knights, and was focused on football.

His family says that night, he packed a gym bag, washed his ankle brace and hung it on the clothesline to dry before heading out for an evening walk.

The teen had asthma, his mother says, and a doctor had recommended he exercise outdoors at night when the temperature and humidity dropped.   Around 10:30, Lennon left his family's small apartment and headed down a dirt road.

His family never saw him alive again.

Just before 7:30 the next morning, he was found hanging from the frame of a swing set in the center of a mobile home community.  According to medical documents, his body was covered in fire ants.

Lennon's mother was called to the scene several hours later, after he'd been placed into a body bag.

"It was unreal.  It was like a dream.  It was like I was not seeing what I was seeing," Lacy says.

Immediately, Lacy believed her son's death was the result of some foul play.

"He didn't do this to himself," Lacy says.

She believes Lennon was lynched.

"He may have either been strangled somewhere else or been placed there or he was hung there while people were around watching him die," Lennon's older brother, Pierre Lacey says.

However, North Carolina's Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Deborah Radisch declared his death a suicide.

When a state investigator asked Lacy if her son had been depressed recently, she told them he had -- because a relative had died recently.  The state medical examiner cited that exchange in the autopsy report.  Lacy says she did not mean that her son had been suffering from depression.

"When you just lose someone close to you, you're going to be depressed, upset, in mourning," Lacy says.

The family says Lennon had not changed his routine and was focused on college and football -- and distracted by his girlfriend.

The teen had been dating a 31-year-old white neighbor.  The age of consent in North Carolina is 16.  Some people in their small, southern town did not like that the two were together.  Lacy did not like their drastic age difference.

"I was shocked, disappointed.  I also, initially told him how I felt - that I did not approve of it," Lacy says.

In the wake of his death, some wondered whether Lennon had been killed because he was in an interracial relationship.

A week after Lennon was buried, a local teenager was arrested for defacing his grave.

"There are too many questions and it very well could be a lynching or a staged lynching.  We don't know -- but what we do know is there has to be a serious and full investigation of these matters," says Rev. William Barber, a national board member for the NAACP.

The NAACP hired Florida-based forensic pathologist Christena Roberts to analyze the case and Dr. Radisch's autopsy, completed for the state.

Roberts' first concern: basic physics.  Lennon was 5-foot-9.  The crossbar of the swing set frame he was found hanging from was 7-foot-6, according to the NAACP review.  With no swings or anything at the scene on which he could have climbed, according to the review, it's unclear how Lennon reached the top.

"His size, his stature does not add up to him being capable of constructing all of this alone - in the dark," Lennon's brother says.

According to the 911 recording and the initial police report, a 52-year-old woman got the 207-pound teen down, while she was on the phone with an emergency dispatcher.

"Dr. Radisch also noted that she was not provided with photographs or dimensions of the swing set.  Without this information, she would be unable to evaluate the ability to create this scenario," according to the NAACP review.

Lacy says she told investigators that the belts used to fashion the noose did not belong to Lennon.

"I know every piece and every stitch of clothes this child has -- I buy them, I know.  Those were not his belts," Lacy says.

The Bladen County Coroner and Medical Examiner Hubert Kinlaw believed the belts might have been dog leashes.

Radisch thought that "some portion must be missing because there was no secondary cut in either belt.  The cut would have been necessary to bring down Lennon's body," according to the review.

Also, the shoes Lennon was wearing when his body was found were not his, according to his family.

Lennon's brother says he left home that night wearing size 12 Air Jordan's.  However, he was found wearing size 10.5 Nike Air Force shoes.  Those shoes were not with Lennon's body when he arrived at the state medical examiner's office, according to the NAACP review.

"He's going to walk a quarter mile from his house in a pair of shoes that's two sizes too small after he takes off his new pair of shoes - and this is a 17-year-old black kid with a brand new pair of Jordan's on.  He's going to take those Jordan's off and just get rid of them and put on some shoes that's not his -- we don't know where he got them from, no laces in them -- and continue to walk down this dirt road late at night to a swing set in the middle of the trailer park and hang himself," Lacey says.

"How can I believe that?" Lacey added.

There are also questions about who first declared Lennon's death a suicide.

"Dr. Radisch noted that her determination of (manner of death) in this case as suicide was based on the information she was provided by law enforcement and the local medical examiner.  She would have likely called the (manner of death) 'pending' while awaiting toxicology and investigation but the (local medical examiner) had already signed the (manner of death) as suicide," according to the NAACP review.

However, in the summary of the case, written the day Lennon was found, the local medical examiner asked "did he hang self?  Will autopsy tell us?"  Kinlaw also left the conclusion on the manner of death "pending."

Local police and state investigators declined to speak with CNN.  CNN asked to interview Radisch about the statements attributed to her in the NAACP review.  Instead, a department spokesperson confirmed the exchanges through a written statement:

"The comments that were released by the NAACP were a synopsis of a professional exchange between the NAACP's independently-retained forensic pathologist and Dr. Radisch," according to a spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.

Lennon's family believes there was a rush to judgment. And until someone clearly explains and proves how her son died, Lacy says she'll keep fighting until she gets answers.

"I take it one day at a time.  That's all I can say," Lacy says.

London, England (VBS.TV) -- In April this year I embedded with the elite soldiers of the 2nd Battalion British Parachute Regiment at their training facility in Thetford, United Kingdom. We went there to film the British army's much-talked-about, multimillion pound "replica Afghanistan village." The focus of the piece was to be on the younger members of the battalion. Some of them are as young as 18 and only months away from their first visit to Helmand province in September 2010. The majority of British casualties are all recorded in that area.

I'd heard about the Afghan village training facility from an ex-Para turned photographer called Stuart Griffiths. A couple of years ago, Vice Magazine published a photo essay in which he visited the homes of badly injured soldiers returned from Iraq or Afghanistan. Perhaps more shocking than the horrific injuries the soldiers had sustained was the lack of support of these men from the British government of the time -- particularly those who suffered psychological problems as a result of combat shock.

Stuart served his time in the Paras on tours of Northern Ireland in the late 80s to early 90s. But after being discharged he fell on hard times. He became homeless and spent a long time wandering the streets of London. He slept in cardboard boxes in doorways, often coming across fellow army veterans who faced a similar lack of support and sympathy from society, the government or the army. Happily, Stuart managed to get himself off the streets and, inspired by the stories of his fellow homeless veterans, became a campaigner of sorts for veterans rights, using his photography. His story and those of other ex-Paras is now available to watch in a moving British documentary called "Isolation."

A week before we set off for the embed, I asked Stuart what kind of experience we were letting ourselves in for and he said: "Not only are the Parachute Regiment Britain's most elite soldiers, they are the most brutal of British troops. That means the rest of the British army are simply in awe of them. I would say around 90 per cent of the SAS (the British equivalent of the Special Forces) comes from the Paras. And so the troops you are going to be sleeping next to every night are some of the hardest men in the world."

"Recently what's happened is that many former veterans have had a "call to arms" and returned to the forces again. Life in civvy (civilian) street has been a huge disappointment for many of these guys. Once you've fought 'in-theater' a number of times it's really hard for you to come back and fit in with the hum-drum of modern life. Especially if you're a Para. They miss the camaraderie and the discipline and the action that you get when you're in combat."

"When Afghanistan first kicked off, all three battalions of the Paras were sent straight there because of their reputation for violence and bravery. I remember it was in Helmand 2006 that Afghanistan became very hairy indeed. The Parachute Regiment were there when it became very intense and at the time a Member of Parliament called John Reid was quoted as saying, 'I'd be quite happy that a single shot is not fired in Afghanistan.' In reality the Parachute Regiment were firing off more rounds in Helmand than the entire Korean war!"

Grinning nervously, I asked him if there's anything else I should know and he looked at me and said, "They all drink rivers of lager."

Before we set off to meet the Paras, Stuart introduced us to a young man named Richard Dare who'd been a private in the Royal Anglians. Richard had a significant part of his brain blown out of his head by a mortar attack and was slowly rehabilitating himself at his home in a small town near Leicestershire. Richard talked to us about his love for the army and for war. The severe injuries to his brain didn't seem to change his love for army life one iota. The more we spoke to him, the more we knew we had to include him in our film.

But first we had to go meet the Paras. With the help of my co-producer Jason Mojica, we packed two small cameras into our bags and traveled to the middle of the British countryside to try and ingratiate ourselves with the most brutal soldiers in the whole of the British army.

It all started off nice and civilized. We were met on the door by a dashing officer who arranged for a private to show us our room -- a basic little number in the middle of the barracks which, while not five star, would certainly meet our needs for the week. I remember feeling pretty pleased with ourselves that we'd been given this amazing access, thinking we'd have carte blanche to wander around and check out the comings and goings of the most elite units in the world.

"Ah," we thought, "This should be an informative and relaxing few days in the countryside. I don't know what we were worried about at all."

Soon we were put in jeep, driven an hour-and-a-half away to a gloomy brick building in the middle of nowhere and told that the next time we slept in a bed would be in five days time. As we stepped out of the van about 200 Para troops stared at us with eyes that said: "Who are these wimps?"

The dark fell fast. A cold wind started blowing and I suddenly realized we'd left all our warm clothes in the barracks miles away. Then the sergeant major introduced himself and told us to get in line with the rest of the troops.

And off we marched into the night.
(CNN) -- Scores of people who had been without bread for days were killed when Syrian warplanes bombed a bakery in the western village of Halfaya, opposition activists said Sunday.

More than 100 people were killed, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The death toll could rise, the activist group said.

An activist who oversaw the burial of many bodies said at least 109 people died.

Hassan Al-Rajb told CNN that 69 people were identified and buried, while 15 others were laid to rest without being ID'd. At least 25 more bodies were still at the site, but hospital workers said the roads were cut off and they were unable to reach the bakery, he said.

The hospitals cannot handle all the wounded, he said.

An LCC activist told CNN he went to the scene.

"There were dozens of dead thrown in the street. The residents were shocked and in a state of fear. It was chaotic," Mahmoud Alawy said.

Videos posted on social media purported to show the aftermath of the attack. Many bodies had limbs apparently blown off, and others lay bloody in the streets and in rubble strewn over a sidewalk. Uniformed Free Syrian Army soldiers and civilians scramble to pull survivors out of the carnage.

CNN cannot independently confirm government or opposition reports out of Syria, as the government has restricted access by journalists.

The town has lacked the ingredients for bread for about a week until an aid group delivered provisions Saturday, Alawy said. Hundreds of people lined up at the bakery on Sunday.

Al-Rajb said the town has three bakeries, and one opened at 1 p.m. Workers began to distribute the bread two hours later. He was on his roof about 200 meters (about 219 yards) from the bakery about 4 p.m. and saw a plane overhead. He scrambled toward the scene when he heard cries of "Emergency! Emergency!" he said.

"The first floor collapsed on the second floor, and four rockets were fired into it," he said of the attack.

Alawy claimed the government has been targeting large gatherings of people with artillery shells in the recent days since the Free Syrian Army liberated the town from Syrian forces.

About an hour after the bakery attack, 15 shells were fired into Halfaya from a nearby town, Al-Rajb said.

The Hama Revolution Command Council, a network of activists affiliated with the FSA in Hama province, said a MiG warplane bombed the bakery.

Many Syrians face food shortages and other needs as winter weather sets in. The United Nations estimates that more than 2.5 million need humanitarian assistance.

Earlier in the week, opposition groups also said rebels and regime forces battled near a hospital in Halfaya. Twenty-five people died there, the LCC said.

SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- The homeless men and women shuffle across the frozen ground of the tent camp and surround a steel drum burning wood. They use the flames to cook food and to stay warm.

The tents in Seattle are covered with tarps and plastic sheets to help keep out the elements.

The tents they live in are small, covered by tarps and plastic sheeting to keep water out. Several tents are collapsed under the weight of a recent snowfall.

For Bruce Beavers, however, this camp is just about the best place in the world he could be living right now.

"This is a place for people who lose their jobs, lose their houses, to have some kind of structure and for them to get back out in the world," he says.

Set up in the parking lot of a church near Seattle, Washington, the camp houses anywhere from 50 to 100 homeless people each day.

Residents call it Nickelsville. The name takes a page from the infamous "Hooverville" shantytowns of the Great Depression that were named for a president many thought did not care about their economic hardships.  Watch resident give tour, explain rules »

Some residents here say they blame Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels and a system they believe makes it difficult to escape homelessness.

"In shelters, if you don't get there in time enough, you don't have your bed no more 'cause there are so many people trying to rush in to get it," Beavers says. "Got a lotta people losing their homes. You don't want to go all the way to the bottom. Nickelsville is kind of a catch in between."

Like many of the other Nickelodeons -- as the people who share this church parking lot call themselves -- Bruce Beavers never expected to be homeless. He managed warehouses and hardware stores, had a 401(k) plan and owned his home. But Beavers said he lived beyond his means and eventually lost everything.

Beavers and other homeless say they were tired of a shelter system that often splits up families into different housing, does not provide a place for people to keep their possessions while they look for work and offers too few beds. So they say they decided to try their own way.

They formed a camp where the homeless living there would know they had a guaranteed place to stay. There would be around-the-clock security to keep people from having their things stolen, the tents would be built from donated materials, and alcohol and drugs would not be permitted. It would be a place for people trying to get out of homelessness.

Evan Balverde is a plumber who came to Nickelsville after an accident forced him to stop working.

"We don't just take in everybody," Balverde says. "We'd like to, but the thing is just a lot of these people out here are mentally incapable or they're drug addicts or alcoholics and stuff, and that's why they are on the streets. We don't put up with that.

"We're here for people in rough times and homeless, but if you are doing it to yourself, then this isn't the place for you."

The dubious legality of the camp set the organizers on a collision course with the city, and several times police have moved the Nickelodeons off the land on which they were squatting. An invitation to relocate the camp outside a local church gave Nickelsville a reprieve, at least for the time being.

Johnny Turner, a homeless man who helped found the camp, says he would like to see Nickelsville grow into a permanent shelter that could accept more people needing a place to go.

"We need more Nickelsvilles," he says. "There's nowhere else."  See photos of Depression-era tent cities »

Al Poole of the Seattle Human Services Department says the city spends nearly $8 million a year on the homeless. Still, there aren't always beds available for every person needing one, and sometimes families do need to be placed in different shelters.

While tent cities might fulfill an immediate need, Poole explains, they also can have the negative effect of turning people who live near the camps against the homeless.

Walking around the neighborhood that borders Nickelsville, it is hard to imagine that many residents are happy that their homes now face a homeless camp.

And many residents were upset, says homeowner Roland Bradley, when the camp first arrived at their street.

"We had a meeting at the church the week before they came," Bradley says. "One of the concerns that people had was about crime and people breaking into their home and children being molested and noise. But that hasn't happened."

Motioning to the camp, Bradley adds: "The reality is that could be us one day."
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius will deliver the Democratic response to President Bush's final State of the Union address - a marquee assignment for a woman who leads a state with fewer than 2 million voters.

Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius speaks at a news conference in June 2007 in Washington.

Sebelius became the 44th governor of the state of Kansas in 2003. She made her first run for governor on a pledge to make the state more business-friendly and increase government efficiency.

The Kansas governor has a political pedigree: Her father, John Gilligan, was a Democratic governor of Ohio in the '70s. But the governor has paid her political dues, with stints as a Kansas state representative and state insurance commissioner.

Since she moved into the governor's mansion, Newsweek has identified Sebelius as "one to watch." Time named her one of four "rising stars from the heartland," and short-listed her as one of the nation's five best governors.

"Mark my words, Sebelius will be on everyone's VP short list in 2008," Democratic blogger Markos Moulitsas said on his Daily Kos Web site, as he applauded her 2006 success in wooing disaffected Kansas Republicans.

Most of the national political figures to come out of Kansas have been Republicans, like President Dwight Eisenhower and former Sen. Bob Dole. But entering her sixth year as governor, Sebelius seems to be everyone's favorite pick to join that select group.

The down-to-earth governor has certified red state appeal with a blue state edge: She loves NASCAR and college sports, running and the Rolling Stones. And the 58-year-old has an offbeat sense of humor. (Sometimes, perhaps, a bit too offbeat for some voters -- like the time she said during an election-year debate that Missouri roads scared her more than the World Trade Center attacks.)

But the big draw for national Democrats is her skill at appealing to moderate GOP voters -- the only way a Democrat can win major office in Kansas. Sebelius has won two gubernatorial elections in a state with roughly twice as many registered Republicans as Democrats. Bush carried the state by at least 20 points in each of his presidential runs and no Democratic presidential contender has won there since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.

When Sebelius was elected governor, Kansas faced a judicial order to increase school spending in the midst of its worst budget crisis since the 1930s. Under Sebelius' leadership, the Kansas economy has rebounded, resulting in low unemployment and the creation of thousands of jobs, according to a Kansas government Web site.

Her first term was considered so successful that during her re-election run, a few Republicans tried to use it against her -- predicting she'd probably be tapped for a White House run before she finished a second term.

So far, Sebelius has downplayed the scenario. But she has begun to have an impact beyond the Midwest. During her first term, she visited National Guard troops in Iraq. Last year, she took on a high-profile national assignment, serving as chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association.

If Sen. Hillary Clinton fails to capture the presidential nomination this year, many Democrats say Sebelius will remain high on any vice presidential short list.

Democrats close to the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama told CNN Sebelius will announce after tonight's State of the Union speech that she's endorsing Obama.  E-mail to a friend
(CNN) -- Track and field star Tyson Gay was handed a one-year ban by the U.S. Anti Doping Agency (USADA) Friday and has had to return the silver medal he won at the 2012 London Olympics.

Gay, a former world 100 and 200m champion, tested positive for a banned anabolic steroid at the U.S. Championships on June 23, 2013 and his suspension takes effect from that date -- making him eligible to compete later this summer.

The standard ban for a doping violation is two years, but Gay has been treated more leniently because he co-operated with USADA, it said.

"We appreciate Tyson doing the right thing by immediately withdrawing from competition once he was notified, accepting responsibility for his decisions, and fully and truthfully cooperating with us in our ongoing investigation into the circumstances surrounding his case," USADA chief executive Travis T. Tygart told the organization's official website.

Gay, who has been one of Usain Bolt's main rivals over the past few years, also accepted the forfeiture of all results and prizes dated back to July 15, 2012, when he first admitted using a product that contained a banned substance.

That included his silver medal in the U.S. men's 4x100m relay squad at the London Games, where they finished second to Bolt's all-conquering Jamaican team.

The shortened suspension length is subject to appeal by the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it was satisfied with the punishment meted out to Gay.

"We note the athlete accepted responsibility for his actions and returned the medal from the London Olympic Games," it said in a statement.

"The IOC supports clean athletes and defends the integrity of sport against those who cheat. We will take all necessary steps with regard to the Olympic Games in line with our zero tolerance policy, and our full commitment to the protection of the clean athletes."

Gay is the joint second fastest man over 100m in history behind Bolt, with a 9.69 seconds clocking.

He won the triple of 100, 200 and 4x100m relay gold at the 2007 world championships in Osaka.

News of his positive test came on the same day that a similar outcome was revealed for former world 100m record holder Asafa Powell, shocking followers of track and field.

Jamaica's Powell received an 18-month ban for his doping offense.
(CNN) -- An appellate court on Thursday ordered a new trial for a Florida woman who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a gun to scare off her allegedly abusive husband, ruling that a jury was improperly instructed on self-defense.

Marissa Alexander's case will be retried because the jury was wrongly told that -- for her to claim self-defense -- she needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that her husband was about to seriously harm her, the appellate court said.

Rather, the appellate court pointed out, the prosecution had the burden to prove that Alexander herself was guilty of aggravated assault.

"Because the jury instructions on self-defense were fundamental error, we reverse" the conviction, a three-judge appellate panel said.

A jury convicted Alexander, 31, of aggravated assault in March 2012 after just 12 minutes of deliberation.

Alexander's lawyer said he told her about the new trial by phone.

"Marissa was ecstatic and obviously she's incredibly thankful and wants to get back with her family," defense attorney Bruce Zimet told CNN.

'Stand your ground' denied in Alexander case

The case gained the attention of civil rights leaders, who say the African-American mother of three was persecuted because of her race, and from others, including U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, who said the sentence was too harsh and Alexander never should have been charged.

Alexander claimed self-defense, saying she was attempting to flee her husband, Rico Gray, on August 1, 2010, when she picked up a handgun and fired a shot into a wall.

She said her husband had read cell phone text messages that she had written to her ex-husband, got angry and tried to strangle her.

State Attorney Angela Corey had said the case deserved to be prosecuted because Alexander fired in the direction of a room where two children were standing.

Corey had said she offered Alexander a plea bargain that would have resulted in a three-year prison sentence, but Alexander chose to take the case to a jury trial, where a conviction would carry a mandatory sentence under a Florida law known as "10-20-life."

The law mandates increased penalties for some felonies, including aggravated assault, in which a gun is carried or used.

Opinion: Shame of mandatory minimums

During sentencing in May 2012, a judge said he had no choice but to sentence her to 20 years.

"Under the state's 10-20-life law, a conviction for aggravated assault where a firearm has been discharged carries a minimum and maximum sentence of 20 years without regarding to any extenuating or mitigating circumstances that may be present, such as those in this case," Judge James Daniel said that year.

Before the trial, Alexander unsuccessfully tried to use Florida's Stand Your Ground law to argue she was immune from prosecution. To win the immunity hearing, she would have needed to show that she was more likely entitled than not to use force.

But a judge in the pretrial immunity hearing rejected the request, saying Alexander's decision to go back into the house was not consistent with someone in fear for her safety.

In Thursday's decision, the appellate court said Alexander would not get a new immunity hearing. But she can still claim self-defense at trial.

The office of the Florida state attorney for Duval County said Thursday that Alexander's conviction "was reversed on a legal technicality."

"We are gratified that the court affirmed the defendant's Stand Your Ground ruling" denying pretrial immunity, the office said.

Hong Kong (CNN) -- At least 2,800 dead pigs have been fished from a Shanghai river since Friday, but authorities insist that tap water in the city is still safe to drink.

State news agency Xinhua said labels tagged to the pigs' ears indicated they came from the upper waters of the Huangpu River, which flows through the center of Shanghai and is a source of the city's drinking water.

It's not clear why the pigs had been dumped in the river, though local media reported earlier this month that a disease had killed thousands of pigs in a village south of Shanghai.

"We will continue to trace the source, investigate the cause, co-operate with neighboring areas and take measures to stop the dumping of pigs into rivers," the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Commission said in a statement posted on their website on Monday.

As of Sunday, water quality on the Songjiang section of the river, where most of the pigs were found, remained normal and the incident has had "no significant effect on tap water supply," the commission added.

However, local residents and users of of the popular Twitter-like microblog service Sina Weibo have expressed concern that the dead pigs would make the city's tap water unsafe to drink.

"Huangpu river is the source of drinking water for more than 20 million Shanghai residents. And this horrific incident was only made public when residents started posting pictures on Weibo," business investor Xue Manzi said in a post on his account.

The agricultural commission said it had tested organ samples from the pig carcasses and the results suggested the animals had contracted a type of porcine circovirus.

According to Professor Fred Leung, who specialises in animal diseases at Hong Kong University, this is a fairly common disease in pigs and not usually fatal on its own.

Pictures showed sanitation workers with sticks retrieving the bloated bodies of small pigs caught up in reeds and debris at the side of the river.

A local newspaper in Jiaxing, a city in Zhejiang province south of Shanghai, reported on March 6 that tens of thousands of pigs had died of an animal disease in a major pig farming village in the past two months.

"According to our records, 10,078 pigs died in January, another 8,325 died in February. More than 300 pigs die everyday in our village, and we barely have any space left to dispose of the dead pigs," a local villager was quoted by the paper as saying.

Chen Yi, a veterinarian at the Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, told the Global Times newspapers that farmers are required by law to dispose of dead animals at community disposal sites or bury them with disinfectant.

(WIRED) -- In an effort to streamline and simplify the maturity ratings of software in mobile app stores, CTIA, the international wireless industry association, yesterday proposed a ratings system that store owners could voluntarily adopt.

Google and Apple basically told the CTIA to stuff it -- they're sticking with their own rating schemes.

"We've put a lot of effort into Android Market's rating system, which now works well globally," Google spokesman Christopher Katsaros said in a statement. "While we support other systems, we think it's best for Android users and developers to stick with Android's existing ratings."

Apple, too, has outlined its app review guidelines in extensive detail, but has not publicly commented on the CTIA app rating issue.

In the Android Market, Google assigns content ratings that range from "Everyone" to "Low Maturity" to "High Maturity," but provides no details on the specific content that inspired its ratings. However, outlines for the ratings are provided in Google's Android Market support forum.

In its App Store, Apple provides an age rating ranging from 4+ to 17+, and lists the reasons for assigning its maturity rating. For instance Plants vs Zombies received a 9+ rating for Infrequent/Mild Horror/Fear Themes and Infrequent/Mild Cartoon or Fantasy Violence.

The CTIA's guidelines aim to score smartphone and tablet apps on a five-point scale based on their violence and sexual content. The ratings, which would be controlled by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (which also controls computer and videogame maturity ratings) would range from "Everyone" to "Adults Only."

Apple's App Store alone has more than half a million apps and Android is getting close to that number with at least 300,000.

CTIA announced it would be developing its app rating system in March. The initiative would call for "voluntary self-certification of apps." The system would make it easier for parents to see -- regardless of mobile platform -- if an app was appropriate for their child. The mobile application rating system was officially announced on Tuesday.

AT&T, Sprint, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile USA, U.S. Cellular and Microsoft are the founding bodies of the age-appropriateness rating system.

It works like this: App developers answer an online questionnaire about their app's content, including whether it shares location information, has a social networking component, and if it contains violence or sexual content, among other things. Apps would receive their rating almost instantaneously, and if a developer disagreed with the assigned rating, it could appeal it. The ESRB would regularly test popular applications and monitor complaints.

Washington (CNN) -- With full military fanfare -- gun salutes, fife and drum corps, brass bands, a flyover and presidential praise -- the nation bid farewell to its top military man and honored his successor Friday.

Adm. Mike Mullen has been Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, the president's top military adviser, since October of 2007.

Army Gen. Marty Dempsey takes his place.

"As the new secretary of defense, I am confident of the future because we have the strongest military force in our history -- and it is strong because we can replace one great warrior with another," Leon Panetta said during the 90-minute Hail and Farwell ceremony on the Fort Myer parade ground across the river from Washington..

It wasn't just the October sun that brightened the day for Mullen. It was also the lengthy praise from the president and from the military he had served for 43 years, as well as the day's latest success in the terrorism fight -- the successful take-down of al Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki.

Obama pointed to Mullen's leadership, from all the advice he provided in the Oval Office about the nation's two wars, to his crucial testimony to Congress that the country should end its ban on gays and lesbians serving open in the military. "Mike, as you look back at your four consequential years as chairman and your four decades in uniform, be assured: Our military is stronger and our nation is more secure because of the service that you have rendered."

Mullen, the son of a Hollywood publicist, is a master of self-deprecating humor. He drew laughter from the crowd when he told a story of how he had been mistakenly identified at a party as the former general, and now CIA director, David Petraeus. And he said that White House meetings went better if participants didn't criticize the president's baseball team, the Chicago White Sox.

"And he really likes it when you laugh at his jokes. It just makes the meeting go better." Mullen said.

Mullen never misses a chance to make a point, hammering a favorite theme, that the American public must become more connected to its military personnel when they come home, giving them a chance, a job, an education.

"Welcome them back to those places, not with bands and bunting or yellow ribbons, but with the solemn recognition that they have done your bidding, they have represented you well, they have carried the best of you and of this country into battle," Mullen said. "They have done things and seen things and bear things in their souls that you cannot know."

Panetta praised Mullen's hard work and dogged persistence. "His leadership, his influence, his honest candor, his compassion and his outspoken concern for our troops have set an exceptionally high standard for the responsibilities and performance of a chairman of the Joint Chiefs," Panetta said.

Dempsey becomes Panetta's and Obama's right hand man in navigating the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the hard choices about budget cuts.

"Marty's strategic vision is the right one for this time of transition as we craft a joint force that can defeat the wide range of complex security threats we face today, and into the future," Panetta said. "In a speech he gave while leading the Army's Training and Doctrine Command, Marty said that the pace of change in today's world requires that we look at the future differently than we have in the past. Instead of trying to leap ahead decades into the future as we design our military, we must build a force able to handle the challenges we know it will face today, and one that can adapt to the future."

Mullen oversaw two wars plus the U.S. role in the Libyan conflict during his four-year term. But in recent weeks he found himself in a final skirmish inside the Obama administration itself over his statements that the extremist Haqqani network along the Afghanistan border was "a veritable arm" of the Pakistani intelligence service.

He chose not to comment directly on that, saying only that in his advice to his successor, "I urged Marty to remember the importance of Pakistan to all of this, to try and do a better job than I did with that vexing and yet vital relationship."

Mullen said Afghanistan will be Dempsey's biggest challenge. "In seeing this critical transition through to its completion, in making sure that the security gains we have made are not squandered by the scourge of corruption or the lack of good governance that still plagues the country, our strategy is the right one," Mullen said. "We must keep executing it."

The new chairman, the first Army general elevated to chairman since 2001, had the last word. "Although you're a sailor and I'm a soldier, in the tradition of the horse cavalry, I want you to know that I will be proud to tell people that I rode with Mike Mullen during some of the most challenging times in our nation's history."
Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Violence flared in central Cairo on Monday as protesters threw Molotov cocktails at police, who responded in kind.

The protesters are angry at the government and the Muslim Brotherhood, a popular Islamist movement. They rallied near Tahrir Square, near the parliament building, just a block from the Interior Ministry.

A building in the area briefly caught on fire and was quickly extinguished. No immediate injuries were reported.

"The violence of the police is the same as the violence under Mubarak," said Tarek Famy, a protester. "The Brotherhood is exactly the same as the former regime. They're still as violent."

Longtime Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was toppled last year. The country is now headed by Mohamed Morsy, the country's first democratically elected president. Before taking office, Morsy was a leader in the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood.

The protests came on the one-year anniversary of deadly clashes on Mohamed Mahmoud Street, which leads from Tahrir Square toward the Interior Ministry.

Violence there last year left dozens of people dead. No one has been held responsible for those deaths, though several security officers remain on trial.
(CNN) -- The designs painted on planes help distinguish one airline from another, using colors that promote and represent the brands.

But with frequent mergers and acquisitions in the industry over recent years, traffic in and out of paint shops has increased to keep planes updated with new airline identities.

The latest to emerge from a respray, covering the remnants of bankruptcy, is American Airlines.

US Airways and American Airlines will form the largest airline in the world by passenger numbers, worth an estimated $11 billion. The new company will retain the American Airlines name, but it will have up to 73 aircraft repainted by the end of this year to reflect its new branding.

The former look of its planes features a silver, bare-metal finish with a red, white and blue stripe running along the body, its iconic logo of an eagle and double A adorning the tailfins. The new design covers the planes in silver paint and puts stripes on the tail.

"It brings American into the Apple age with its nice reflective coating," says Sudeep Ghai, a strategist with Athena Aviation, and airline management consulting firm.

"I think where there are challenges are perhaps some of the brand mark elements that have been left behind, which have been around for 40 years," Ghai says, referring to the airline's logo, which has been radically changed.

In recent years, the six major U.S. carriers have consolidated into three. Northwest Airlines was completely absorbed when it merged with Delta in 2008. Two years later, Continental merged with United.

With each merger, airlines must choose carefully which parts of brands to hold onto. In the case of Continental and United, the newly formed company kept Continental's distinctive logo of a yellow globe.

"They did a very sensible thing, actually. They retained the United name -- the more recognized name worldwide -- with the Continental logo," says Willie Walsh, the CEO of International Airlines Group, the parent company of British Airways. "And I think that was meant to bring the Continental people into the business. There's a sense of inclusiveness, which I think was a smart move."

There are instances of companies getting the rebranding wrong, Walsh says, like the unpopular tailfin designs on British Airways planes in the late 1990s. "But out of that came something fantastic: the Chatham flag, the livery that we have on our aircraft today," he says.

Acquisitions and the new coats of paint that often follow have been cropping up across Europe, too. After IAG bought the airline British Midland International from Lufthansa last year, dozens of BMI's planes needed to be repainted to reflect its new branding, a process that used around 750 liters of spray paint per plane.

Meanwhile, Lufthansa is getting ready to relaunch Germanwings, a low-cost airline that it acquired in 2009. Part of the preparations involves repainting the fleet in the new Germanwings livery, which incorporates colors that signify Lufthansa's ownership.

"We decided we needed a fresh approach. And what you see in our new livery is Lufthansa's yellow colors and our raspberry colors," says Thomas Winkelmann, the CEO of Germanwings.

And passengers can expect more fresh paint jobs ahead, as the flailing airline industry continues to see mergers as a way to strengthen businesses.

"It happens on a slow-drip basis," Walsh said, "but I think we'll see more consolidation, and I think the industry recognizes that it is a positive development."
(CNN) -- Joao Victor Marcari Oliva could become one of Brazil's brightest Olympic talents, if he can step out of the shadows of a legend: his mum.

Oliva is the son of Hortencia Marcari, who led Brazil's women to the basketball world title in 1994 and Olympic silver at the Atlanta Games two years later.

"Hortencia is a celebrity at the level of a great soccer star here in Brazil," says basketball writer Marcos Antonio.

"She was a born scorer, a 'clutch player' -- it was almost impossible to block her shots. She was always on TV."

Oliva says: "Every time I'm walking down the street with my mum, there are a lot of fans taking photos of her and people asking for autographs. Sometimes that gets boring -- but it's nice."

A fraction taller than his mother at 180 cm (5 foot 10 inches), the teen has shunned a career in basketball. His heart is set on an entirely different sport: dressage.

"I have my mother's blood when it comes to sport, but my father bred horses. When I was young, I spent all my time with them," says the 18-year-old, whose mother played in the Atlanta '96 basketball final just months after he was born.

"If my mother was someone else, I wouldn't be talking to you. A lot of people in the media speak to me because they know my mum. I think that's a good thing: it's good for me, and good for my job."

With a home Olympic Games two years away, the Brazilian equestrian team is in the middle of an unprecedented push for success on the world stage.

Oliva belongs to the next generation of Brazilian riding talent hoping to capture imaginations, if not medals, at Rio 2016.

Brazil has virtually no history of dressage -- one of three equestrian disciplines at the Olympics -- so Oliva has moved to Germany, one of the sport's leading nations, to find better tuition.

"I don't want to win in Rio -- I don't think that's possible," he says. "I have a lot to learn and Europe is too strong in the sport. But I'm here, and I will learn like a European. I think I can be a good rider."

The nation has hired world-renowned experts to help its riders develop. New Zealand's Mark Todd, for example, is coaching the Brazilian eventing team.

Todd is one of the most successful riders in the history of eventing, which combines dressage, cross-country riding and showjumping. At 58, he has twice won Olympic titles (in 1984 and 1988) alongside three bronze medals, including one at London 2012.

"The Brazilians are a long way behind, but they're very enthusiastic," says the 58-year-old, who coaches some of the riders at his base in Wiltshire, England, alongside several trips to South America each year.

"One of the things which struck us most is how little they knew. Yes, they could all ride. But as far as training horses goes? A lot of them didn't have much of an idea about basic stuff.

"Another thing I will say is that the funding system from the government is very hard to fathom. Although there is money available, the system isn't practical and there are huge amounts of red tape. You're asked to do a job and they say there will be help, but you spend six months of the year faffing around."

Moving to Europe, like those who have moved to train with Todd, is a rite of passage for many Brazilian riders. Standards are markedly higher east of the Atlantic.

Showjumper Marlon Zanotelli moved to Belgium to further his career, even though -- unlike dressage and eventing -- his discipline has history in Brazil. Zanotelli is aiming to follow in the footsteps of his hero, Rodrigo Pessoa, at his home Games in Rio.

Pessoa, now 41, became a star of Brazilian horse sport by winning jumping gold at the Athens Olympics in 2004. He has a world title and many other honors to his name.

"Rodrigo has always been my idol," says Zanotelli. "When they talk about horses, people talk about Rodrigo -- even people who have never seen showjumping. They know who he is.

"There will never be another Rodrigo but I want to win medals and events like he did."

The 26-year-old spent his childhood on the road with his father, a moderately successful eventer named Mario, at tournaments across Brazil.

"Everything is completely different in Europe," says the younger Zanotelli. "In Brazil almost everyone has grooms, everyone is spoiled. Here in Europe, most people do all the jobs themselves -- they help the horse themselves, they know how to do everything.

"Luckily, my dad always made me do everything too, so I had some experience of that. Otherwise, I would have arrived here and been completely lost."

Brazil has no shortage of aspiring talent: comparatively new faces like Oliva and Zanotelli line up alongside the likes of Doda Miranda in showjumping and Roger Clementino -- the first African-Brazilian to reach the Olympics, who taught a young Oliva -- in dressage.

Then there is Luiza Almeida, who made her Olympic dressage debut at Beijing 2008 aged just 16, the youngest equestrian rider in the history of the Games.

But Todd says Brazil's success in 2016 will depend on finding quality horses before Rio.

"No matter how good the riders are, you've got to have good horses, too," he cautions. "And good horses take time to produce.

"One of the biggest problems for Brazil is the lack of horse power. Although the Olympics are two years away, two years is nothing in terms of getting a horse educated to compete against all the other countries at the top level."

The Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games, taking place in France, are the biggest test of Brazilian riders -- and their current lineup of horses -- prior to the Rio Olympics.

But the riders are already looking to Rio, and what could be the greatest equestrian show of their lives.

"Brazil will put on a great party," says Zanotelli, who rode well to sit 22nd, seven places behind compatriot Pessoa, after two rounds of showjumping at the World Equestrian Games.

"Many people said many things about the World Cup -- even Brazilians were saying bad things about it -- but in the end, it was a big success.

"This is a big country, and we have a lot of issues, but when the time comes for an event we have really good people who love to host foreigners and put on a good show.

"Every day, when you wake up in the morning, an Olympics in your own country gives you the motivation to keep working. I think it's going to be amazing."
BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A man identified as an Iraqi journalist threw shoes at -- but missed -- President Bush during a news conference Sunday evening in Baghdad, where Bush was making a farewell visit.

President Bush, left, ducks a thrown shoe as Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki tries to protect him Sunday.

Bush ducked, and the shoes, flung one at a time, sailed past his head during the news conference with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in his palace in the heavily fortified Green Zone.

The shoe-thrower -- identified as Muntadhar al-Zaidi, an Iraqi journalist with Egypt-based al-Baghdadia television network -- could be heard yelling in Arabic: "This is a farewell ... you dog!"

While pinned on the ground by security personnel, he screamed: "You killed the Iraqis!"

Al-Zaidi was dragged away. While al-Zaidi was still screaming in another room, Bush said: "That was a size 10 shoe he threw at me, you may want to know."  Watch Bush duck the shoes »

Hurling shoes at someone, or sitting so that the bottom of a shoe faces another person, is considered an insult among Muslims.

Al-Baghdadia issued a statement Sunday demanding al-Zaidi's release.

Al-Zaidi remained in custody Monday while the Iraqi judiciary decides whether he will face charges of assaulting al-Maliki, a government official said.

The official said al-Zaidi is being tested for alcohol and drugs to determine if he was fully conscious during the incident.

Al-Zaidi drew international attention in November 2007 when he was kidnapped while on his way to work in central Baghdad. He was released three days later.

Bush had been lauding the conclusion of a security pact with Iraq as journalists looked on.

"So what if the guy threw his shoe at me?" Bush told a reporter in response to a question about the incident.

"Let me talk about the guy throwing his shoe. It's one way to gain attention. It's like going to a political rally and having people yell at you. It's like driving down the street and having people not gesturing with all five fingers. ...

"These journalists here were very apologetic. They ... said this doesn't represent the Iraqi people, but that's what happens in free societies where people try to draw attention to themselves."

Bush then directed his comments to the security pact, which he and al-Maliki were preparing to sign, hailing it as "a major achievement" but cautioning that "there is more work to be done."

"All this basically says is we made good progress, and we will continue to work together to achieve peace," Bush said.

Bush's trip was to celebrate the conclusion of the security pact, called the Strategic Framework Agreement and the Status of Forces Agreement, the White House said.

The pact will replace a U.N. mandate for the U.S. presence in Iraq that expires at the end of this year. The agreement, reached after months of negotiations, sets June 30, 2009, as the deadline for U.S. combat troops to withdraw from all Iraqi cities and towns. The date for all U.S. troops to leave Iraq is December 31, 2011.

Bush called the passage of the pact "a way forward to help the Iraqi people realize the blessings of a free society."

Bush said the work "hasn't been easy, but it has been necessary for American security, Iraqi hope and world peace."

Bush landed at Baghdad International Airport on Sunday and traveled by helicopter to meet with President Jalal Talabani and his two vice presidents at Talabani's palace outside the Green Zone.

It marked the first time he has been outside the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad without being on a military base.

The visit was Bush's fourth since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003.

Afterward, Talabani praised his U.S. counterpart as a "great friend for the Iraqi people" and the man "who helped us to liberate our country and to reach this day, which we have democracy, human rights, and prosperity gradually in our country."

Talabani said he and Bush, who is slated to leave office next month, had spoken "very frankly and friendly" and expressed the hope that the two would remain friends even "back in Texas."

For his part, Bush said he had come to admire Talabani and his vice presidents "for their courage and for their determination to succeed."

As the U.S. and Iraqi national anthems played and Iraqi troops looked on, he and the Iraqi president walked along a red carpet.  Watch President Bush and Iraq's president walk the red carpet »

Bush left Iraq on Sunday night and arrived Monday morning in Afghanistan, where he will met with President Hamid Karzai and speak with U.S. troops.

In remarks to reporters, National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley, who traveled with Bush, described the situation in Iraq as "in a transition."

"For the first time in Iraq's history and really the first time in the region, you have Sunni, Shia and Kurds working together in a democratic framework to chart a way forward for their country," he said.

On Monday, new violence in Iraq showed that work remains to be done.

A suicide car bomb attack killed at least three people and wounded 31 others west of Baghdad on Monday, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. The noontime bombing targeted civilians on a road between Khan Dhari and Abu Ghraib, according to the official.

Also, the U.S. military said three militants were killed and 13 others were detained in operations targeting al Qaeda in Iraq on Sunday and Monday. The incidents took place in Baiji, Tall Sumayyir, Tikrit, near the towns of Abu Ghraib, Mahmoudiya and Kirkuk.

(CNN) -- Barcelona beat Real Madrid 3-2 at the Camp Nou on Wednesday to claim the Spanish Super Cup in an ill-tempered El Clasico clash.

Lionel Messi's volley two minutes from time secured a 5-4 aggregate triumph for Josep Guardiola's side, after French striker Karim Benzema's goal in the 82nd minute looked to have forced the Spanish season's traditional curtain-raiser into extra-time.

Tempers flared in injury time when Brazilian full-back Marcelo's dismissal for a lunging tackle on Barca debutant Cesc Fabregas sparked a mass brawl between the two sets of players.

Barca's Spain striker David Villa and Real's Germany playmaker Mesut Ozil were red-carded for their involvement in the melee, despite both players having already been substituted.

Real coach Jose Mourinho also became involved when he was seen to poke the eye of Guardiola's assistant Tito Vilanova.

Recent matches between the two teams have seen similar scenes, with five clashes between the archrivals last season resulting in five red cards.

Having drawn Sunday's first leg 2-2 at the Bernabeu, European champions Barca went ahead in the tie when Andres Iniesta latched onto a through ball from FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Messi and clipped a finish over Iker Casillas in the Real goal.

Copa del Rey winners Real equalized five minutes later, when Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo prodded Benzema's low cross into the back of the net.

Barca regained the lead on the brink of half-time, when Messi found the net following a neat back-heel from center-back Gerard Pique.

Benzema scored a second equalizer for Real before Messi's late strike stole glory for Barca, but Mourinho was happy with what he saw from his charges.

"Real Madrid gave a spectacular performance from the first to the last minute," Mourinho told the nine-time European champion's web site. "I just say what I think. We came here to play.

Former Inter coach Mourinho stopped short of criticizing the referee for sending off two of his players, but the 48-year-old did appear to suggest Barca's players had made the most of the fouls which were committed.

"The referee must punish what he deems punishable," he said. "Pepe and Marcelo played a great game, one for the entire 90 minutes and the other for 45. Pepe saw a booking for a minor tackle and Marcelo gave a great performance.

"I'm not going to say we're happy because we didn't win the Spanish Super Cup; that would be hypocritical of me. We intend to play like men and not fall on the ground at the slightest touch."

Guardiola has now won 11 major honors since becoming Barca coach in 2008 and the former club captain was delighted with his team's performance.

"What will stay with me is the inhuman effort of the players," he said. "They responded like the players they are: eternal, mythical, unrepeatable, honest, who like to train and play football.

"Truthfully, seeing the way they responded, it's a privilege and honor to be their manager."
Glasgow, Scotland (CNN) -- [Breaking news alert, 6:23 a.m. GMT (01:23 a.m. ET)]

Scotland will remain part of the United Kingdom -- along with England, Wales and Northern Ireland -- following a historic referendum vote. A majority of voters rejected the possibility of Scotland breaking away and becoming an independent nation.

With 31 of 32 councils declared, the "No" campaign has won the referendum on Scottish independence.

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond admitted defeat in Scotland's independence referendum Friday -- and urged the rest of Scotland to do the same.

In a televised statement, he thanked Scotland "for 1.6 million votes for Scottish independence."A turnout of 86% is one of the highest in the democratic world for any such vote, he said.

[Original story published at 12.37 p.m. ET]

Voters in Scotland made their choice Thursday -- remain part of the United Kingdom, or form their own independent nation. They chose to remain.

With 31 of 32 of councils reporting, the "No" campaign had garnered enough votes to secure their victory, and with it Scotland's continued place within the union.

The first councils to declare all went to the "No" campaign, as did the capital, Edinburgh, which voted overwhelmingly to stay in the union with 123,927 for "Yes" and 194,628 "No" votes. Argyll and Bute and Aberdeenshire also voted "No."

Glasgow delivered a solid win for the independence camp with 194,779 votes for "Yes," and 169,347 for "No," but lead was not big enough to overturn the "No" camp's overall majority so far, which maintains a 8% (54% to 46%) lead over pro-independence camp.

The majority of the early results have been going the anti-independence camp's way. The "No" campaign extended lead with Angus and East Dunbartonshire council results, alongside a landslide in Dumfries and Galloway. The oil-rich city of Aberdeen also strongly voted for the unionist camp.

The city of Dundee was the first big gain for the independence campaign, voting "Yes" with 53,620 votes for, 39,880 against.

The individual counts by local authorities are ultimately immaterial as it is the total number of votes countrywide that will determine the outcome.

Polls at more than 5,500 stations across all districts, from the remote highlands and islands to the big cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, closed at 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET). People still in line to vote at that time were allowed to cast ballots.

High turnout

The first districts to report turnout reported high participation -- well over 80% in most cases -- Mary Pitcaithly, chief counting officer, announced in Edinburgh.

Turnout in Glasgow, one of the Yes campaign's heartlands, was a relatively disappointing 75%.

More than 4.2 million people registered to vote on the question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"

A vote for independence would mean Scotland, with its population of about 5.3 million, splits from the rest of the United Kingdom, made up of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, in addition to Scotland.

"The people of Scotland have engaged in this conversation," Phil MacHugh, a spokesman for the "Yes" camp, told CNN on Thursday night. "They have really gone out there, found out the information that they wanted to know, and made that choice today."

Prime minister's address

British Prime Minister David Cameron will make an address Friday morning. The content will depend on the outcome of the vote, but in the event that Scottish voters decide to stay in the union, Downing Street says he will refer to plans for further redistribution of powers from the central government to the Scottish Parliament, signed by Westminster leaders earlier this week.

The counting officer for Edinburgh, Sue Bruce, explained just after 10 p.m. that each ballot will be double-checked, to verify each voter's decision.

Addressing dozens of election workers, Bruce added, "I look forward to working with you during the course of the evening to deliver an accurate and transparent Edinburgh count in which you and the voters of Edinburgh can have full confidence."

Voting was brisk at one polling station in Glasgow as the polls opened Thursday, with many people voting on the way to work or before taking their children to school.

Bad weather or the sheer volume of votes cast could slow down the counting process. However, the weather forecast appears good so far -- important when some ballot boxes must be collected by helicopter, plane or boat from polling stations on distant islands.

Allegations of voting fraud were reported by Glasgow City Council, with several instances of people turning up at voting booths in Scotland's largest city to vote, only to be told that they had already voted.

The Council stressed that there was never actually a situation of double voting and the affected ballots are now being searched for and taken away.

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, who has led the pro-independence "Yes Scotland" campaign, cast his ballot Thursday morning in the village of Strichen, Aberdeenshire.

Labour lawmaker Alistair Darling, who has headed the pro-union "Better Together" campaign -- backed by the main parties in Westminster -- voted in Edinburgh, while former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, another pro-union campaigner, voted in the town of Kirkcaldy.

For the first time, the vote was extended to 16- and 17-year olds living in Scotland. Nearly 110,000 people younger than 18 have registered to vote.

Voters in the referendum did not have to be British citizens; Commonwealth, Irish and EU citizens who live in Scotland and are registered to vote there can cast a ballot. However, Scots living outside Scotland do not have a say.

Nearly 790,000 people applied for a postal vote -- the largest volume of registration for postal votes ever in Scotland.

After the polls closed, Salmond tweeted, "This has been a remarkable day. Scotland's future truly is in Scotland's hands."

(Oprah.com) -- A businesswoman, a mother of four, an international fashion icon, a woman committed to making the world a better place for women and children -- Queen Rania of Jordan is truly changing the world.

Queen Rania says cultural dialogue, education and increased opportunities are ways to combat terrorism.

Rania Al-Yassin was born in Kuwait. Shortly after Saddam Hussein invaded that country in 1990, her family fled and settled in Jordan. After graduating from business school, Rania began working her way up the corporate ladder.

When she was just 22, she went to a dinner party where she met Jordan's Prince Abdullah -- considered one of the world's most eligible bachelors. He didn't remain one for long after that night. Six months later, Rania and Abdullah had a royal wedding and started a family. And, though they planned for a life as royals, Abdullah assumed he'd remain a military officer for life.

In 1999, while on his deathbed, King Hussein of Jordan stunned his country by announcing that his son Abdullah -- not his brother -- would succeed him as king. That made 29-year-old Rania the world's youngest living queen.

Rania says that being queen is not the trait she defines herself by. "I am not at all conscious of it," she says. "I make a conscious effort not to be conscious of it. Because I'm Rania, you know? People call me 'Queen,' but, you know, that's not me ... I'm Rania."

There are many perks to being queen, of course, but Rania stresses that there are also responsibilities.

"One of the major misconceptions about this position is that people think that I might be far removed, that I might not be in touch with reality," she says. "The honest truth is that my life is very much about dealing with issues on the ground, dealing with ... the problems that our country faces. That's something I do on a daily basis."  Watch how Queen Rania uses technology to reach young people »

When most people think of queens, they probably think of what they know from fairy tales. "For me, it's just real life," Rania says. "I am a mother. I care about my children. I worry about what they eat. I worry about the influences from their friends."

Rania is not only sitting royalty in Jordan, she's raising the next generation of royals too. She is the mother of four children -- 14-year-old Hussein, 12-year-old Iman, 8-year-old Salma and 3-year-old Hashem.

Rania says her family tries very hard to remain down to earth. The family has relaxed much of the ceremonial pomp and circumstance of their position. Rania prefers that people not refer to her as "Your Majesty" ... and King Abdullah loves to barbecue!

The family never discusses the possibility that Hussein, their oldest child, could be the future king of Jordan, Rania says. Instead, she says the family strives to remain like any other family. For instance, to get the things they want, the children have to clean their rooms and do well in school.

"The most important thing is to instill them with the right values," Rania says. "I just feel that values are the shield that you carry with you throughout life. It protects you from whatever life throws at you."

Rania has become famous around the world for her efforts to improve educational opportunities for girls and the rights of women. "In my mind, poverty is a 'she,'" Rania says.

Helping others is something Rania says she feels compelled to do. "Once you feel that others are like you, then you want for others what you want for yourself," she says. "And that way you start helping others."

Rania explains that there is a direct relationship between increasing education and eliminating poverty. "You can change the course of a nation through education," she says. "One of the most important things you can do for a girl is empower her with her education. Once she has the education, she can then have control over her income, she can change her life, she can have choices."

To understand what life is like for the women in Rania's kingdom, "The Oprah Show" spent a day with a few women in Amman, the capital city of Jordan.

One woman named Muna worries about striking a balance between work and motherhood. Part of that means preparing lunch -- the most important meal in Jordanian culture -- for her family. Unlike in America, most children and husbands return home to eat with their families for lunch. Just like in America, Muna cooks a variety of meals, everything from traditional Arabic food to hamburgers and spaghetti.

In this largely Muslim country, one religious tradition is increasingly a matter of choice. Approximately 60 percent of Jordanian women wear a veil. Though Queen Rania says she has never worn a veil, she understands why a woman would want to.

"We think it's a personal choice," she says. "Unfortunately, in the West, people look at the veil as a sign of oppression or weakness. This is not true as long as a woman is wearing it because of her belief. I always say we should judge a woman according to what's going on in their heads rather than what's going on top of their heads."

Rania says that when people focus on differences between cultures -- especially stereotypes and things like veils -- they fail to realize just how similar all people are. "Once you go beyond the mannerisms, the language, the cultural idiosyncrasies, you realize that you're basically the same, you know?" she says.

Rania also wants to break down the stereotypes the West holds about her culture. "I would like to dispel the misconception that Arabs are all extremists, that Arab people are violent and that women in the Arab world are oppressed and suppressed," she says.

The struggle we feel today is not really Middle East against the West, Rania says, but rather it is between extremists and moderates of all religions. "We need to speak up," she says. "The biggest nightmare for the extremists is for us to get along, and that's why we have to get along. We have to communicate more."

In the future, Rania says she hopes for a more open and secure world. "We look at problems happening halfway across the world and we think, 'Well, that's their problem.' But it's not," she says. "When you solve somebody else's problem, you're solving a problem for yourself because our world today is so interconnected."

Rania says solving problems that stem from intolerance -- like terrorism -- require cultural dialogue, education and increased opportunities. "We have to create opportunities for our youth so they have a chance in life," she says. "Whenever you're frustrated and you feel like you don't have a future or you can't get a job, then you're more susceptible to be influenced by terrorism and extremist ideology."

Ibrahim Abdel-Wahab Abdel-Azeem is one of the last traditional craftsmen in Egypt making the oud, the guitar-like instrument heard in so much Arabic music.

He is one of only six or seven oud makers still working in the historic Mohamed Ali Street in Cairo. It takes him a week to make one oud for sale, molding it from thin layers of wood that are joined together without using nails.

"We bring big chunks of wood and then we cut it into thin layers," said Abdel-Azeem. "First we put those layers on the hot iron. Later we bend it. When it comes out we glue it together because the Oud doesn't not have any nails."

Abdel-Azeem, 62, inherited his art from his father and started out in his workshop while he was still at school.

"The profession is originally Egyptian and moved to Syria and Turkey, but my father brought it back to Egypt," said Abdel-Azeem.

Abdel-Azeem was only 14 when his father died and he took over his workshop. It is not just a job to him, but a way of life. "Oud is the Sultan of music and songs," said Abdel-Azeem. "Without oud there's no music. It's the base to any other instrument.

"Making an oud requires artistic talent. It's not only a trade because when the oud is not made properly or the sound coming out of it is not right we become emotionally depressed."

See also: Egyptian student sends spiders in to space

But he worries that the trade will die out. "The only people left making ouds are only six or seven people in the country. No one is interested in learning it anymore.

"If it continues this way this profession will die. Other instruments took over. We used to take oud classes in school. They don't teach oud anymore except in colleges of music."

Another man working hard to keep the tradition of the oud alive is Naseer Shamma, one of the most famous musicians in the Middle East.

Shamma, 47, is a composer, performer, poet and now a teacher. He left his native Iraq during Saddam Hussein's rule and moved to Cairo where he now runs a "House of Oud" music school with branches in Egypt, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates.

"I think if anybody needs to change the life around him he needs to do something really in education," said Shamma. "For example, not just composition or just concerts; we need another line to continue with the new generation for that this is my project for all my life."

Among his students is Ahmed Al-Sheikh, an 11-year-old Syrian boy who has just passed his final exams at Shamma's House of Oud school in Abu Dhabi.

"My dream is to be a big artist," said Ahmed. "When I close my eyes, I dream of being on stage and hearing people applaud for my music."

It is teaching children like Ahmed that keeps Shamma believing in his work.

"I need to change the life in Arab world, but if we need to change we need to start with the boys, with the small girls, with the culture in the beginning," he said.

Together, they are ensuring this centuries-old tradition will be passed on to generations to come.

(CNN) -- A mother and two children drowned inside a car Friday after floodwater washed their vehicle away, a Pittsburgh city official said.

The city experienced a heavy storm and flooding shortly after 4 p.m. Friday, said Michael Huss, Pittsburgh director of Public Safety.

"The manhole covers began to lift from the rush of water, and the roadway flooded," Huss said.

CNN affiliate WTAE reported that the incident took place in the eastern Pittsburgh neighborhood of Highland Park in Pennsylvania.

Huss said the family's vehicle washed down the roadway and got stuck next to a tree.

"The three could not get out of the car before it was submerged," Huss said. "The water had a lot of force behind (it), and all three inside drowned."

In addition, Huss said, "We have one person whose car was located, but that person is still unaccounted for."

Dive units were searching late Friday night.
Homs, Syria (CNN) -- Dark-haired and swaddled in a white blanket, baby Fatime is just 24 hours old, the picture of innocence in her grandmother's arms.

But the world she has been born into is anything but innocent.

Her mother gave birth to her in a makeshift shelter in the besieged Syrian city of Homs, the heart of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime.

Her mother, 19, has no painkillers and could not sleep after giving birth, she said, still in excruciating pain.

Fatime's father does not know his child has been born -- a month ago, he left the wood-cutting factory that has been turned into a makeshift bunker. He was going for supplies and has not been able to return, his wife says.

Fatime's father may live to see her, but two great-uncles will not, her grandmother says. Both men were detained and returned as mutilated corpses.

As she describes what happened to one of her brothers, her voice trembling, the grandmother grabs her head, wrapped in a black headscarf, and twists it to suggest a neck being broken.

She shows a photograph of the battered body of her other brother, the state of the corpse horrific.

Baby Fatime is one of at least two dozen children holed up with mothers, grandmothers and other relatives in this makeshift shelter in the Homs neighborhood of Baba Amr.

Government forces have been shelling Homs since early February.

The families in the shelter have found relative safety but little comfort.

"We're not sleeping at night, we're not sleeping during the day," one mother howls, clad head to toe in black with her face covered by a niqab, an Islamic veil showing only her eyes.

"The children are always crying; the bombs are coming down like this," she laments, waving her arms for emphasis.

They huddle in near darkness, some covering their faces as they speak to me, afraid of losing more than they already have if the government learns who they are.

The room is filled with endless stories of death and despair.

One woman says her son has been detained since the end of August. Another says her son also has been held a month and a half.

A woman named Safaa says her brother and husband were killed when a round hit their home 10 days ago, but she can hardly pause to grieve.

"I have to keep going," she says. "I have to live for my children."

The families in the shelter survive on rice and lentils taken from a nearby government warehouse, but supplies are running low.

Activists gather about two dozen children for the camera and lead a song against the regime.

But the little ones are hard to comfort.

"My husband died on the first day of the bombing. They didn't let me see his body; it was shredded to pieces. His blood is still in the streets," says Umm Khidir, one of the mothers.

But her focus now is on her son. She says he is sick with a fever, and there's no medicine.

"He keeps crying and saying, 'I want daddy, I want daddy.' I can't bring his daddy back," she says, demanding to know why the world is not coming to their aid. "What is the world waiting for? For us to die of hunger and fear?"
New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- In September of 2005, no one could have anticipated what we saw in New Orleans last week. What happened on the football field and parade route after the Saints' Super Bowl victory is amazing and uplifting. But what's happening elsewhere in New Orleans also rises to that standard.

Consider the following:

The day before the Super Bowl, New Orleans participated in a historic mayoral election, as Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu won a stunning 66-percent of the vote, with unprecedented support among all races.

African-American candidates also won down-ballot races with majority white support, casting a blow to the notion that New Orleans politics and culture are mired in racial tension.

Just weeks before, federal arbitrators awarded $475 million to Louisiana for the replacement of Charity Hospital in downtown New Orleans which makes way for a multibillion dollar medical corridor that is being billed as the largest development project in the city's history.

And in late 2009, a federal judge ruled that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' mismanagement at the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet was the cause for flood damage in the Lower Ninth Ward and St. Bernard Parish following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Damages paid to local governments and residents will exceed $1 billion. These judgments validate many locals' beliefs that the flooding of 80 percent of New Orleans and the billions of dollars in damage were caused more by massive engineering failures than a natural disaster.

To that point, the government is working on a $15 billion upgrade to the region's 220-plus miles of levees and flood walls that, when completed, will allow them to withstand a storm with a strength level that occurs roughly once every 100 years. Even today, experts will tell you the levees are better than they were before Hurricane Katrina.

Additionally, the population is nearing 80 percent of pre-Katrina levels, in part due to hardworking residents who came back and a new crop of younger, entrepreneurial transplants moving to the city to be part of what is going on here.

The New Orleans economy is bearing the recession better than most, evidenced in one of the lowest unemployment rates of any major metropolitan area in the country. Also, the city now has a bond rating that is investment-grade, which should free up access to tens of millions of dollars for infrastructure improvements.

One of the brightest spots in post-Katrina New Orleans has been in education. In Orleans Parish, academic performance scores in the school district have risen nearly 25 percent. The school system looks to get a ten-figure lump-sum settlement to rebuild school properties across the city. And with over half of its students in charter schools and a large and influential Teach for America corps, New Orleans has become a laboratory and model for education reform.

All of this is not to say that everything is going perfectly in New Orleans. Mayor-elect Mitch Landrieu and New Orleanians still have remarkable challenges to tackle and tough decisions to make -- including reducing violent crime, eliminating blighted housing, continuing to rebuild communities and business, and restoring wetlands that provide much needed storm protection. But there is a unity of purpose (thanks in large part to the Saints) that wasn't there even six months ago.

The recovery and rebirth includes citizen-driven reform of local government -- a government once marked by corruption, nepotism, incompetence and the like. New Orleanians voted to consolidate the seven assessor's offices, the criminal and civil sheriffs, and the various levee boards. But most importantly, New Orleanians elected an outstanding man as mayor this past Saturday to lead the next phase of recovery.

The mayoral election was nothing short of staggering, and the confluence of the Saints win and the historic mayoral election, lined up for the city's best two days since the Battle of New Orleans in 1815.

Landrieu was elected in the primary (there will be no runoff) with 66 percent of the vote, including 63 percent of African-Americans and 70 percent of white voters. To say this broad support is unprecedented would be a gross understatement.

Landrieu becomes the first white mayor to govern the majority-African-American city in some 30 years. (His father, Moon Landrieu, was the last white mayor.) And he does it after winning all but one precinct in the primary election. In Landrieu, businesses, congressional leaders, nonprofit organizations and average citizens will finally have a leader and partner in a united city government that promises to restore confidence and get dollars flowing to projects that need them.

Add to that the fact that New Orleans will be front and center on the world stage for much of the next decade, hosting a series of national and international sporting events, including Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, back-to-back NCAA Men's and Women's Final Fours, and the Bowl Championship Series National Championship in 2012, among many others. In 2015, the nation will celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans. And in 2018, New Orleans' tricentenary will focus not only on the founding of New Orleans but also its successful rebirth 300 years later.

You see, the effort to rebuild and recover has been not just an engineering feat to save a city, an entire culture has been at stake. We have our own cuisine, music, architecture, funeral traditions, literature and cultural structure. And as of late, it looks like it will be preserved.

More restaurants are in operation than before the hurricane, New Orleanians took home two Grammy awards this past year, and many important cultural sites have reopened recently or are scheduled to reopen soon.

The world should take notice. Thanks to the Saints, you're looking. But take a deeper glimpse beyond football at what's going on here. For as challenging a decade as the 2000s were for New Orleans, the 2010s may prove to be the brightest time in the city's nearly 300-year history.

The momentum is building.

New Orleans is not just coming back and not just on its way back. New Orleans is storming back.

(CNN) -- Rapper Gucci Mane has been arrested -- again.

This time it's for disorderly conduct, possession of marijuana and for carrying a gun, Atlanta police said.

The arrest took place early Saturday morning on an Atlanta street after a man flagged down officers who said he was concerned about the way his friend was acting.

Officers approached the friend -- later identified as Radric Davis, which is Gucci Mane's real name -- and began speaking with him.

Mane became "increasingly agitated," police said, cursing and threatening the officers.

DMX arrested again

They took him into custody and discovered he was carrying a handgun and a small amount of marijuana.

Mane, 33, is a convicted felon, and so, cannot be in possession of a weapon.

In March, Mane was arrested for hitting a man over the head with a champagne bottle at an Atlanta night club. The man told police the incident occurred after he tried to strike up a conversation with the rapper.

In 2010, he was arrested in Atlanta for violating a number of traffic laws. But they were dismissed for want of prosecution.

In 2005, Mane was charged with murder in the shooting death of a man -- but the charge was later dropped because of insufficient evidence.

Rap mogul Marion 'Suge' Knight arrested
Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- Security for Pope Francis' visit to Brazil has been raised after an incident involving his motorcade, a Brazilian federal official told CNN.

The papal visit is now classified at the highest level of security -- it was raised to "high risk" from "medium risk" after his car got stuck in a crowd of enthusiastic followers Monday, the official said.

The source says the problem in part stemmed from the pope instructing drivers not to avoid crowds.

After Francis arrived in Brazil on Monday, he got into a silver hatchback Fiat for the drive from the airport to downtown Rio de Janeiro. Along the route, the vehicle became pinned between a bus and a crush of well-wishers who were reaching into the car to touch the pope.

Federal authorities are now taking a larger role in Francis' security during his time in Brazil.

Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the globe have come to Rio for World Youth Day, a weeklong festival held every two years. The Vatican told reporters that 500,000 people came to Copacabana Beach for the opening ceremony and Mass. Crowds stretched down the beach for more than half a mile from the main stage.

Brazil: Police found, destroyed bomb before pope's visit

A call for hope

The pope traveled Wednesday morning to the town of Aparecida, the site of a shrine to Our Lady of Aparecida, a clay statue of the Virgin Mary and one of the patron saints of Brazil.

A large crowd -- braving rain -- cheered as the pope emerged from the helicopter that took him to the site, where he held Mass.

In his homily, the pope called on the faithful to find hope in God.

"It is true that nowadays, to some extent, everyone, including our young people, feels attracted by the many idols which take the place of God and appear to offer hope: money, success, power, pleasure," Francis said. "Often, a growing sense of loneliness and emptiness in the hearts of many people leads them to seek satisfaction in these ephemeral idols."

His was an upbeat message, encouraging "openness to being surprised by God" and proclaiming that "Christians cannot be pessimists."

The pope also announced that he will return to Brazil in 2017, the 300th anniversary of the apparition of Our Lady of Aparecida to three fishermen.

(CNN) -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday quarantined an international flight in New Jersey after a passenger became ill on the plane, authorities said.

United Airlines Flight 998 from Brussels, Belgium, touched down at Newark Liberty International Airport at 12:15 p.m.

CDC quarantine officers met the plane after one of the 255 passengers was vomiting on the flight, officials said.

The passengers were released at 1:50 p.m. and permitted to go through customs, said Erica Dumas, a Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesperson. The sick passenger and his daughter were taken to a hospital for evaluation. Passengers said it took another two hours to clear customs and retrieve their luggage.

The incident comes amid heightened concerns after Thomas Eric Duncan, who had recently arrived from Liberia, on Tuesday was confirmed as the first case of the deadly Ebola virus diagnosed on American soil. Duncan arrived in the United States after a connection in Brussels.

The possibility of a new case was knocked down later Saturday by the New Jersey Department of Health.

In a statement, it said that University Hospital "in coordination with federal, state and local public health officials evaluated two individuals who arrived" Saturday afternoon.

"The symptoms of one individual were found to be consistent with another, minor treatable condition unrelated to Ebola," the health department said. "The second individual, who was traveling with the patient, was asymptomatic."

The health department said that both passengers will be let go and "self-monitoring," meaning they'll be in charge of gauging their health.

This statement appears to close the book on this situation, from the health department's perspective.

But it was a very different story just a few hours earlier.

CDC officials removed the man and his daughter while other passengers remained on board. The two passengers were escorted by CDC officials in hazmat gear.

Dumas said the response was standard procedure with sick passengers, but it was unclear how long the protocol has been in place.

"They were wearing masks and gloves on the plane," said a passenger from Paris who identified himself only as Chris. They came with whole suits like you see on TV everyday in Africa."

Passenger Rich Burchett told CNN he was sitting next to the sick man.

"He nudged me and asked me to get the flight attendant," Burchett said. The man told him, "I need a flight attendant. My eyes are floating. I've never felt this way before. They hurt."

According to Burchett, a flight attendant asked the man where he was traveling from. He responded: Liberia.

"Immediately they both left and some time passed and they came back and asked him for his name," Burchett said of the flight attendants. "He handed them his passport. They came back with white masks and asked [the man and his daughter] to put them on."

The sick passenger and the girl were taken to the back of the plane, Burchett said.

The plane landed about an hour and a half later. An announcement was made about a sick passenger. People were asked to stay in their seats. More than an hour passed.

"They told us they were waiting on the CDC and everyone realized the gravity of the situation," Burchett said.

Nearly two hours after the flight landed, Burchett said, an announcement was made: "Everyone can leave. He is not contagious."

Passengers were given forms to fill out so that the CDC can follow up with them. They were handed an information sheet with Ebola symptoms.

"We did get an announcement from a representative of the CDC that we were held as an abundance of caution," Burchett said.

Burchett and other passengers were critical of the response.

"My concern is, if this were something that were highly contagious, we did not seem to have a very good reaction plan," he said. "We seemed very uncoordinated at the airport. I hope we learn from it."

Passenger Henry Costa, a talk show host from Monrovia, Libreria, said the man did not initially show signs of illness.

"He didn't seem sick and then all of sudden I saw them taking him out," he recalled. "He looked strong but they say he was vomiting."

Costa said he had spoken with the man and his daughter before the flight left Liberia.

"He was lively," Costa said. "His daughter was very inquisitive. She asked so many questions. Apparently, it was her first time flying."

The man and his daughter were taken to University Hospital, where the emergency room will not accept anyone else for four hours, CNN affiliate WABC reported.

In a statement this week, the CDC said quarantine inspectors meet arriving aircraft and ships reporting ill passengers or crew to assist them in getting appropriate medical treatment. The agency CDC has a network of quarantine stations at 20 ports of entry and land-border crossings.

"If the flight crew of a commercial aircraft arriving in the U.S. becomes aware of an ill person on board which may include a person with Ebola symptoms, the captain is required required by law ... to report the illness to the nearest U.S. Quarantine Station, who will arrange the appropriate medical response at the flight's destination airport," the statement said.

Can you catch Ebola on a plane?

On Saturday, CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden addressed the growing concerns about the deadly disease.

"We have already gotten well over 100 inquiries of possible patients," Frieden told reporters. "We've assessed every one of those ... and just this one patient has tested positive ... We expect that we will see more rumors or concerns or possibilities of cases, until there is a positive laboratory test, that is what they are."

Fighters with the militant group the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria reached the triangle border between Iraq, Syria and Turkey, it said in a message posted on Twitter on Sunday.

ISIS took control of Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam on Iraq's Tigris River, which provides power to the city of Mosul about 50 kilometers (31 miles) to the south, the commander of the Peshmerga Kurdish fighters who had been defending the facility said Sunday.

The dam workers remained inside the facility, which fell after a 24-hour battle, Lt. Col. Herash said.

A "horrendous prospect"

ISIS -- known for killing dozens of people at a time, while carrying out public executions, crucifixions and other acts -- has taken over several cities as it seeks to create an Islamic caliphate that encompasses parts of Iraq and Syria.

Daniel Pipes, the president of the Middle East Forum, said seizing dams is a tactic the group uses to gain control of a town and its people.

No dam, however, is as formidable or as important to Iraq as the one in Mosul.

"If you control the Mosul Dam, you can threaten just about everybody," Pipes told CNN's Jonathan Mann.

Pipes said the militant group now has the potential to create a flood so massive and catastrophic that it would not only cause death, destruction and chaos locally in the city of Mosul, but more than 450 kilometers (280 miles) away in Baghdad as well.

"It's a horrendous prospect," he said.

Peshmerga Kurdish fighters also pulled out of the towns of Zumar and Wana after being surrounded by ISIS fighters and isolated from any support, Kurdistan Democratic Party regional official Ismat Rajab told CNN on Sunday.

The United Nations in Iraq warned that 200,000 civilians were trapped in a dire circumstances after ISIS and associated armed groups "seized control of nearly all of Sinjar and Tal Afar districts in Ninewa Province, including the oil fields of Ain Zala and Batma, bordering the Kurdistan Region of Iraq."

Most of the refugees are from the Yezidi sect and have fled to Jabal Sinjar, the United Nations said.

"The humanitarian situation of these civilians is reported as dire, and they are in urgent need of basic items including food, water and medicine.  An unknown number of civilians are also reported to have moved towards Dahuk and Zako in the Kurdistan Region."

ISIS to Christians in Mosul: Convert, pay or die

ISIS took control of Sinjar, a small town inhabited by the Yezidi sect, on Saturday, according to police officials.

An ISIS Twitter posting linked to a statement referencing "the battle of opening the borderline between state of Ninawa and Dohuk provinces."

"The Islamic Caliphate legions have launched since this morning" operations towards the northwestern regions bordering state of Nineveh," the statement said. "God facilitated for the mujahedeen to break into many important areas controlled by the Kurdish gangs and secular militias."

The State Department said Sunday that it was "actively monitoring the situation" in Sinjar and Tal Afar, and said that the U.S. is supporting both Iraqi security forces and Peshmerga forces in the fight against ISIS.  "The (ISIS) assault over the past 48 hours on territories along the border of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region and focusing on towns and villages populated by vulnerable minorities, demonstrates once again that this terrorist organization is a dire threat to all Iraqis, the entire region, and the international community," spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.

U.S. agrees to send 5,000 more Hellfire missiles to Iraq
(CNN) -- Anything creative begins with a question.

The problem is that questions take us into uncertainty, which is a very dangerous place to be. If there were a predator next to you and your brain wasn't absolutely sure what to do, then it'd probably be too late.

The need to translate ambiguous sensory information into meaningful behavior has been the fundamental drive of brain evolution, without which survival in a complex world would not have been possible. And yet a deep irony is that the best questions -- i.e., the ones that challenge our deepest sense of what is true -- create the most uncertainty.

So how is it possible to be creative? Fortunately nature gave us a solution, which in the context of human culture we call science. Not science reduced to the Methods section of a paper, but science as a "way of being," where not only is uncertainty celebrated, but so too are possibility, diversity and openness. In other words ... play.

Watch Beau Lotto's TED Talk

Armed with this idea that science is play (and thus experiments are games) I asked whether we could not simply teach children about science, but actually enable them to become the scientist and in this way offer children an essential tool for contending with the uncertainty that is inherent to life. The answer to this question was the Blackawton Bees Project.

Through the course of several "workshops" spread over three months, Dave Strudwick and I went on a journey with 25 children aged 8 to 10 years old. The journey was broken down into several distinct stages, but what happened within each stage was an emergent consequence of the interactions with and between the children.

The first step was "Wonder," since without it there's no motivation to ask a question. The second was to ask "Why?" the third "What If?" and the fourth -- "Who Cares?"

In other words, the focus was not on coming up with answers to questions set by a teacher (in which the answers are already known), but on asking questions -- novel questions -- that were of interest to the children. In this instance, those questions came in the context of bumblebee visual behavior.

The children came up with the idea of seeing if bumblebees could learn to recognize different spatial configurations of color, which is important for bees in deciding which flowers to go to for foraging and was a relatively unknown area of science.

TED.com: E.O. Wilson's advice to young scientists

It should be noted that we did not receive funding for this project largely because it was thought that children "... could not do it," and because the funders required the process to be fully prescribed, which is like asking an artist to describe what the painting is going to look like before he/she paints it, or to describe the results of an experiment before even the question itself has been devised.

The result was tremendous. Not only did the children devise meaningful questions, but also crafted games (i.e. experiments) to address them. They made the subsequent observations and working together created a "story" about the process and their observations. It was the latter that was submitted for publication.

TED.com: Yep, I built a nuclear fusion reactor

Naturally, while the editors of nearly every biologically-based science journal -- including the most prestigious journals -- were interested in the story and process, none were willing to review the manuscript because it wasn't written in the typical style of a science paper. This, however, creates a problem. If one has observations that are both novel and relevant obtained from a robust scientific method, are the findings made less important by mode of communication? (The paper was eventually published by the journal Biology Letters; read it here.)

The Blackawton Bees Project demonstrates that by participating in real science, we can all become observers of the intimately private process by which our brains make sense of the world. By becoming actively involved in the process of making sense, the children not only became the scientist -- and thus learned about science from within -- but the process fostered in each child a sense of choice, creativity and compassion.

TED.com: Award-winning teenage science in action

These latter motivations are, I'd suggest, the true reasons for changing the way science is currently taught in our schools -- to "See Myself See:" to become actively aware of how our environment, perception and imagination shape who we are as an individual and as a society. This arguably unique human capacity is the principal act of consciousness that has the power to transform our view of the world and of ourselves, since it creates the opportunity to find and create new relationships that will shape future behavior.

(CNN) -- So we thought Asian kids did great in school. Think again.

A new study suggests that women and minorities are less likely to receive early support from potential academic mentors. Researchers from Wharton, Columbia and NYU ran an interesting field experiment: Pretending to be students, they e-mailed more than 6500 professors at top U.S. universities admiring each professor's work and asking to meet. The e-mails were all identical except for the senders' names.

Names that one can associate with a gender or race -- like Brad Anderson, Meredith Roberts, LaToya Brown, Juanita Martinez, Deepak Patel, Sonali Desai, Chang Wong, and Mei Chen -- were used.

The researchers found that faculty were most likely to respond to e-mails from white males. But more surprising was the high level of racial bias against Asians and Indians -- professors were likeliest to ignore e-mails from these students.

One of the researchers noted, "We see tremendous bias against Asian students and that's not something we expected. ... A lot of people think of Asians as a model minority group. We expect them to be treated quite well in academia."

The study highlights the pernicious nature of the "model minority" stereotype of Asians, and the fact that Asians are still viewed as the most foreign "other" in our American culture -- perhaps the biggest outsiders in the politics of "not like us."

A common refrain I hear from well-meaning friends and colleagues is: "What's so bad about the Asian stereotype? Seems to me Asians have done all right." I get it. As a woman of color, I'm keenly aware that on the spectrum of bias, there are plenty of worse things to be called than good at school. It doesn't sound so terrible to be thought of as hardworking or quiet when there are so many more obviously sinister racial myths out there to bust.

But the flip side of the model minority myth is an assumption that Asians do just fine and don't need any mentoring or help in the academic or professional world. Whether due to bias or mere lack of interest, the professors in the study treated Asian and Indian students differently despite their reputation for academic achievement.

And this lack of mentorship while in school may lead to an achievement gap in the workplace. There's still a huge disparity between the percentage of Asians graduating at the top of their class from the best schools in the country and the percentage of Asians who go on to achieve top leadership positions in their chosen fields.

Disturbingly, I have heard thoughtful colleagues wonder aloud whether the underrepresentation of Asians in senior leadership roles is due to systemic, external factors that should be addressed with reform in the workplace, or whether it's Asians who are responsible for taking themselves out of the C-suite pipeline because "they're just happy being the worker bees."

Is there any truth to the perceptions that Asians are passive, lack leadership skills and assertiveness, are unwilling to take initiative or risk, and even unable to have fun or a decent sense of humor? Some people definitely think so.

I'm not the only American of Asian descent who has been told, in the form of a compliment, that I'm surprisingly outgoing, funny, or sociable -- for an Asian. I still get friendly compliments on my "very good English." And at one of my very first legal job interviews, one judge put it succinctly: "I've always thought your people were very bright."

It's the very benignity of these model minority stereotypes that render them so persistent and difficult to eradicate.

So, what can we do about it?

We can start by improving mentor and sponsor programs. Mentors and mentees are too often arbitrarily paired in the corporate world. Employers should consider the real affinities that may actually exist within their workforce and offer employees the tools, training and access to identify, cultivate and maintain their own meaningful mentor and sponsor relationships.

At one law job early in my career, I was assigned to a "mentor" who himself had only been at the firm a few weeks. Why? He was from Seoul. I'm from California and grew up in D.C. And I'm not even Korean-American. Meanwhile, I went to a college that graduates about 400 students a year, and a white male senior partner whose office was down the hall had gone to this same small college, yet no one at the firm had stopped to think that perhaps I might have something in common with him.

Sure, it's also incumbent on people to take initiative and simply walk down the hall and introduce themselves to potential mentors. But it would be incredibly helpful and transformative for the gatekeepers -- in academia, the corporate world, public service, media, entertainment and the arts, whatever path talented young people might choose -- to recognize the subtle, unconscious biases that sometimes prevent Asians from achieving their true potential.

Maybe then Asians in America can be recognized for bringing more to the table than just being good at school.

Q & A with author Helen Wan about 'The Partner Track'
(CNN) -- Just 24 months before the showdown in the Midwest, CNN's Peter Hamby reported this week that possible presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton may have an Iowa problem -- and may again have difficulties winning the state in the 2016 caucuses -- because of weaknesses among the state's most progressive voters.

But that analysis fails to understand and appreciate the country's changing demographics and where U.S. politics is heading.

Clinton hasn't announced whether she'll run for president again. But whether or not she has an Iowa problem, Iowa is largely unrepresentative of America's changing composition. It's 91% white in a country that's 64% white, and it will have a shrinking role in choosing future U.S. presidents.

And, even if Clinton does have an Iowa problem, she will probably have a Georgia solution. The composition of the South and Southwest has now changed to the point where Democrats have a real chance of winning statewide elections for seats long held by Republicans.

Here are the facts: Nine out 10 of Iowa's 3 million residents are white. The state has six electoral votes and 65 delegates. In contrast, 63% of Georgia's 10 million residents are white. They have 16 electoral votes and 124 delegates. In 2012, President Obama lost Georgia by 300,000 votes in a state that has 600,000 eligible, non-voting African-Americans.

And the Georgia solution begins with Michelle Nunn.

The 47-year-old daughter of respected of Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn -- who served for 24 years as one of the state's leading Democrats -- is running for Senate and is poised to prove that a Democrat (and a woman) can win the Georgia seat held by a Republican for the past decade.

Nunn is tied in the polls and has proven to be a formidable fundraiser. Her campaign paves the way for a Clinton win in Georgia because the ground operations and campaign infrastructure she's built will probably assist Clinton's efforts in the state.

As the first woman to hold a Senate seat from the state of Georgia, she readies the electorate to vote for a female president.

In a similar way, Wendy Davis' gubernatorial bid in Texas helps a potential Clinton campaign. Texas is another battleground state with significant numbers of voters of color -- who could one day help turn that state from red to purple -- and Davis' statewide win may pave the way to a Clinton victory in Texas. (PAC+ has publicly endorsed the candidacies of both Nunn and Davis.)

There is a new majority emerging in America, and it's not about Iowa. It's about Georgia, Texas and other states where people of color will make the difference.

These are states where rapid population growth over the past 10 years has resulted in increased electoral votes. Arizona's population increased nearly 25%, and it now has 11 electoral college votes -- one more than they had last time around. Colorado's population increased 17%, and it has nine votes. Florida gained two electoral votes for a total of 29, based on a nearly 18% population increase. Nevada gained one electoral vote, bringing its total to six to reflect a whopping 35% population increase in 10 years. It's a trend that experts expect to continue, and these are all states with large and growing populations of people of color.

In Georgia -- whose primary has usually been held well after Iowa's caucuses -- a changing political landscape is not the exception, it's the rule. Democrats must look forward and invest in the coalition of the future. They must meaningfully connect with communities of color and progressive whites and champion policies that address inequality and immigration and education.

That way, as the Iowa caucuses continue to recede in significance, the Democrats still can win for years to come.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- Additional police officers were patrolling Los Angeles International Airport and two other airports Wednesday after a former Transportation Security Administration employee was accused of making a false threat against LAX, authorities said.

The beefed-up patrols were also a precaution on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, police said. The two other airports are LA/Ontario International Airport in Ontario, California, and Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles, police said.

"In light of recent events at Los Angeles International Airport involving a disgruntled former airport worker and the 9/11 anniversary tragedy, Los Angeles Airport police has enhanced the deployment of uniformed officers in and around LAX, Ontario and Van Nuys airports.

"Officers will be highly visible on foot, bikes, motors, in patrol vehicles and managing traffic," Los Angeles Airport Police Chief Patrick M. Gannon said in a statement provided by his spokeswoman.

"The safety and security of the traveling public, employees and visitors is our priority and we encourage the traveling public to report all suspicious activity. If you see something say something, security is everybody's business," Gannon said.

Nna Alpha Onuoha, a former Transportation Security Administration employee, made his initial appearance in a federal court in Los Angeles on Wednesday afternoon to face a count of making a false threat and a count of making threats against interstate commerce, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office.

At the request of Deputy Federal Public Defender Samuel Josephs, the detention hearing was continued until Monday at noon PT, Mrozek said.

The two charges together carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, he said.

Onuoha, 29, of Inglewood, California, is a former screener with the TSA at LAX, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.

On Tuesday afternoon, the FBI received information from the TSA confirming that Onuoha had resigned from his position with the agency, which he had held since 2006, Eimiller said. He was suspended between July 21 and July 27 after he reportedly told a 15-year-old girl that she should "cover up," according to an FBI affidavit filed in court.

After his resignation Tuesday, Onuoha allegedly left a package at TSA's LAX headquarters addressed to a TSA employee, the FBI said.

A bomb squad with Los Angeles Police inspected the package, Eimiller said.

It didn't hold explosives, but it did contain an eight-page letter in which Onuoha expressed his thoughts about the incident that led to his suspension and disdain for the United States, among other opinions, Eimiller said.

Later in the day, a man believed to be Onuoha contacted the TSA by telephone, instructing an employee to "begin evacuating certain terminals at the airport," Eimiller said in a statement.

The caller told the employee that he would "be watching" to see if TSA was evacuating the terminals as he instructed, the FBI said.

A second phone call was received by TSA from a male caller, also believed to have been Onuoha, who again advised the TSA employee that specific terminals at LAX should be evacuated, the FBI said.

Police cleared the terminals, but no threats were found, the FBI said.

At Onuoha's apartment, the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force found a note taped inside a closet containing an unspecified threat citing the 9/11 anniversary.

The handwritten message said: "09/11/2013 THERE WILL BE FIRE! FEAR! FEAR! FEAR!" according to the FBI affidavit filed in court.

After waiving his Miranda rights, Onuoha told the FBI that the note referred to how he intended to start preaching in the streets on September 11, 2013, court papers said. He also told the FBI that he didn't intend for the statements in the phone calls to LAX to be threats.

Onuoha was arrested outside Los Angeles, in Riverside, California, by task force members assisted by Riverside police, authorities said.
(CNN) -- Tiger Woods is no longer officially considered one of golf's top 50 players, ending a streak that extended back 15 years.

According to the official World Golf Ranking, the 35-year-old Woods entered the weekend as the sport's 50th best player. But he lost that standing when Louis Oosthuizen finished tied for fifth at this weekend's Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland, earning him a place in the standings and ousting Woods.

The rankings are endorsed by Professional Golf Association tours in the United States, Europe, Australia, Asia and elsewhere, according to the World Golf Ranking website. An updated ranking comes out every Monday.

The last time Woods was not among the top 50 was on October 13, 1996. Since then, he won 14 major championships -- a distinction used for the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA championship -- and, for much of the next 778 weeks, ranked as the game's best player.

In recent years, Woods has been plagued by the fallout surrounding his infidelity and divorce from his wife as well as numerous injuries. His last tournament win was the Australian Masters in November 2009.

His next competition will be this week at the Frys.com Open in Corde Valley, California. Despite his recent slump, American team captain Fred Couples chose Woods as one of his wild card picks for next month's Presidents Cup in Australia.

London (CNN) -- Prince William and Kate Middleton will go on a royal tour of Canada in June and July, his office announced Wednesday. It will be the first official foreign trip for the couple after they marry in April.

They will visit Alberta, the Northwest Territories, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and the National Capital Region between June 30 and July 8, Clarence House said.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper had extended the invitation for the tour upon hearing of the couple's engagement.

"Canada is delighted that Prince William and Miss Catherine Middleton will be travelling to Canada as they embark on their first overseas tour as a married couple. " Harper said.

"Canada looks forward to welcoming the young couple this summer and providing them with all that our country has to offer -- including, of course, the special hospitality and warmth reserved for members of the Royal Family."

Canada is seen as a safe bet for a royal debut as a married couple. Queen Elizabeth II, William's grandmother, remarked on her trip to Canada last year that for the royals, the country is a "home away from home."

William is second in line to the British throne.

The timing of the visit means they will not be attending the wedding of Prince Albert of Monaco on July 2.

Months after accepting asylum in Russia, fugitive U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden on Thursday asked Russian President Vladimir Putin about Moscow's own surveillance practices.

"Does Russia intercept, store or analyze in any way the communications of millions of individuals?" Snowden asked in English via a video link during Putin's annual question-and-answer program, which was broadcast on state television. "And do you believe that simply increasing the effectiveness of intelligence or law enforcement investigations can justify placing societies, rather than their subjects, under surveillance?"

Putin responded that Russia has a special service that bugs telephone conversations and Internet communications to fight crimes, including terrorism, but only with court permission and only "for specific citizens."

"So, the mass character is something we do not have and cannot have," Putin said in Russian.

"On such a mass scale ... we do not allow ourselves to do this, and we will never allow this. We do not have the money or the means to do that," he said.

Putin, a former intelligence agent, noted that his questioner, a former National Security Agency contractor, shares that background. "So, we can speak in professional language," he said.

Snowden last year disclosed details of the vast U.S. surveillance network put in place after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, including the government's record keeping on billions of phone calls.

Anticipating legal consequences, he fled to Moscow.

U.S. authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property.

Last month, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told National Public Radio that U.S. officials must plan for the possibility that Russia has access to American battle plans and other secrets.

"If I'm concerned about anything, I'm concerned about defense capabilities that he may have stolen from where he worked, and does that knowledge then get into the hands of our adversaries -- in this case, of course, Russia," Flynn said.

He cited intelligence capabilities, operational capabilities, technology and weapons systems as potential subjects that Snowden -- and now Russia -- may have.

"We have to assume the worst case and then begin to make some recommendations to our leadership about how do we mitigate some of the risks that may come from what may have been compromised," Flynn said.

Last October, Lon Snowden visited Moscow, where he told reporters that his 30-year-old son told him he had had no contact with Russian security or intelligence.

In January, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the Snowden leaks caused serious damage to U.S. security.

"What Snowden has stolen and exposed has gone way, way beyond his professed concerns with so-called domestic surveillance programs," Clapper said then. "As a result, we've lost critical foreign intelligence collection sources, including some shared with us by valued partners."

The nation's adversaries were "going to school on U.S. intelligence sources' methods and trade craft, and the insights that they are gaining are making our job much, much harder," he told the committee.
(CNN) -- President Abraham Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd, needed a baby-sitter.

It was April 18, 1864, and the Lincolns had planned to go to a fair in Baltimore, returning the next day. They needed someone to watch their 11-year-old son, Tad.

A newly published letter from Mrs. Lincoln requesting a sitter gives rare insight into the family's life inside the Lincoln White House, showing one way the family had to juggle their busy schedules, just like everyone else.

The letter is being offered for sale by the Raab Collection, a dealer in historical documents, valued at $15,000.

It's not long -- just one line -- but the signed letter is in the first lady's hand.

"Hon. Mr. Harrington, We would like to have the services of Charles from today, at 2 P.M. until tomorrow at 11 A.M. Very Resp. Mrs. Lincoln."

"Charles" was Charles Forbes, a Treasury Department employee who was detailed to the Lincolns and often served as the president's valet, footman, messenger or attendant, according to the Raab Collection.

George Harrington was assistant secretary of the Treasury and Forbes' boss and handled personal financial matters for the Lincolns.

"Children in the White House have always held a great fascination with the American people," said Nathan Raab, vice president of the Raab Collection. "It shows the president and first lady at their most personal, their most human."

Mary Todd Lincoln ended up not going to the Baltimore event, likely too burdened with preparations for a reception the next night, the final White House reception of the season, Raab says.

Forbes' close family relationship soured a year later when President Lincoln was assassinated. Forbes was seated outside the president's box at Ford's Theatre and was the one who allowed the assassin, John Wilkes Booth, to enter. Forbes and the president's guard then left for a drink, leaving Lincoln unattended, Raab says.

Mary Todd Lincoln ended up blaming Forbes for her husband's death.

"Lincoln," a film about the 16th president and his battle to end slavery, is up for 12 Academy Awards this year, including best picture. The ceremony is scheduled to be broadcast Sunday night.
(CNN) -- A pro-gay marriage group can continue to picket Target stores in California but must do so 30 feet away from a store entrance, a judge has ruled.

The retail giant had filed an injunction trying to keep Canvass for a Cause from picketing at its stores statewide. A California Superior Court judge in San Diego County denied that injunction but placed specific rules on what the group can do, according to court documents filed Thursday.

The group can only canvas one store entrance at any given time so customers' acces to the store isn't impeded, the judge ruled. Also, group members are not allowed to "harass, follow, stalk, or block movements of Target's employees, management or customers."

"Target was denied a restraining order against Canvass for a Cause, citing there was no evidence volunteers were threatening or harassing! This is a win," the San Diego group said on its website.

The group began picketing Target after the corporation donated $150,000 to MN Forward, a organization that supported the failed gubernatorial campaign of Republican Tom Emmer, who opposes same-sex marriage.

Target has since apologized for the donation.

Gregg Steinhafel, the company's chairman, CEO and president, sent a letter to Target managers and employees in August.

"We remain fully committed to fostering an environment that supports and respects the rights and beliefs of all individuals," Steinhafel wrote.

(CNN) -- In 2003, the BET Awards had a priceless moment when Michael Jackson surprised his idol, James Brown, by showing up on stage where the duo thrilled the audience with an electrifying performance.

Michael Jackson performed with James Brown at the BET Awards in 2003. This year's show is dedicated to Jackson.

Now, both the King of Pop and the Godfather of Soul are gone.

Sunday night's 9th Annual BET Awards is sure to be filled with tributes to Jackson, whose videos and performances were a staple for the network in his heyday. BET has already paid tribute to the singer, going wall-to-wall with Jackson videos Thursday night.

Many of the celebrities scheduled to attend the show were also fans of the singer and it is expected that the night will provide an opportunity for them to salute the star.

"Words cannot capture the impact Michael Jackson has had on pop culture around the world," said Debra L. Lee, chairman and chief executive officer of BET Networks. "He changed the way we hear and feel and move to music; he epitomized what true musical talent and star power really mean. He is and always will be the King of Pop."

Academy Award-winning actor and R&B singer Jamie Foxx is set to host the show.

Several of the scheduled performers include artists, such as Ne-Yo and Beyonce, who have acknowledged the influence of Jackson on their music and careers.

The annual event is a premier one for the network and this year's plan was to recognize the musical legacy and longstanding career of the legendary soul trio, the O'Jays, with the presentation of the Lifetime Achievement Award.

Artists Alicia Keys and Wyclef Jean are to be honored with the Humanitarian Award for their respective charitable work.

BET CEO Lee said Sunday's show will be dedicated to Jackson and will also pay tribute to his legacy.

Lee reflected on Jackson's career and his importance to BET -- which stands for Black Entertainment Television -- in a prepared statement after his death, while also offering heartfelt prayers for the singer's family and friends.

"Michael's influence is felt every day in so many ways at BET Networks, and it's been that way throughout our network's entire 29-year history," she said. "We watched him grow up and, like everyone around the world, he feels like he is a member of our family.

"He will be missed more than we can say ... but his legend and memory live on in the artists, musicians, producers, dancers, fans and everyone else who looks to him for inspiration."

The BET Awards is scheduled to run live on the cable network Sunday at 8 p.m.
Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Between 2010 and 2012, more than a quarter of a million people died in the famine in Somalia -- in part because the world was too slow to react, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Somalia said Thursday.

Half of the 258,000 Somalis who died in the famine were children younger than 5, Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement.

The report, jointly commissioned by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network, is the first scientific study on deaths in the crisis.

It "confirms that we should have done more before famine was declared on 20 July 2011," Lazzarini said.

The world did not do enough after warnings in 2010 that starvation loomed following severe drought. And the people who needed help the most were extremely inaccessible, he said.

Opinion: Somalia famine a 'crime against humanity'?

"The suffering played out like a drama without witnesses."

A massive mobilization of the humanitarian community followed the official U.N. declaration of famine, said Lazzarini, which "helped mitigate the worst effects of the crisis."

The study, which covered the period from October 2010 to April 2012, suggests that an estimated 4.6% of the total population and 10% of children younger than 5 died in southern and central Somalia.

In the worst-affected area, Lower Shabelle, close to one in five children younger than 5 died.

At the peak of the crisis, between May and August 2011, famine and severe food insecurity claimed some 30,000 lives a month, the report said.

The United Nations has been working with its humanitarian partners to change the way they operate, Lazzarini said. Some 2.7 million people in Somalia are still in need of life-saving assistance.

Opinion: Why Americans should care about famine in Africa

"Our aim is to ensure that Somalia never goes through another famine again," he said.

'Catastrophic shocks'

Several factors led to the crisis, according to the report.

First, the year from July 2010 to June 2011 was the driest in the eastern Horn of Africa in 60 years. This resulted in the death of livestock, small harvests and a big drop in demand for labor, cutting into household incomes.

Southern Somalia also received less humanitarian assistance in 2010 and much of 2011 than it had in previous years, particularly 2008 to 2009, the report said.

In many areas, conflict and security concerns -- prompted by the activities of al Qaeda-linked Islamist group al-Shabaab -- hindered humanitarian aid and access.

And with reduced supplies available, the price of food staples soared, putting more pressure on poor households.

"For millions of Somalis, already weakened by chronic food insecurity and persistently high levels of acute malnutrition, the shocks were catastrophic," said the report.

The result was what the researchers say was one of the worst famines in the past 25 years.

Their estimate of the number of people who died from the famine -- on top of those who died as a result of conflict or other causes -- was calculated using a range of information, including mortality surveys and data on food prices and wages.

"We now have a picture of the true enormity of this human tragedy,'' said Mark Smulders, a senior economist for the FAO.

"Lessons drawn from this experience will help the international community, together with the people of the region, build a stronger and more resilient future."

'Political failures'

International humanitarian organization Oxfam said Thursday that the mistakes made in Somalia in 2011 must never be repeated.

"Famines are not natural phenomena, they are catastrophic political failures," it said in a statement.

"The world was too slow to respond to stark warnings of drought, exacerbated by conflict in Somalia, and people paid with their lives. These deaths could and should have been prevented, and such a shocking death toll must never be allowed to happen again."

World leaders meeting in London next week to discuss the situation in Somalia "must take steps to ensure that this was Somalia's last famine," Oxfam said.

This means investing in long-term development, creating jobs, supporting farmers and pastoralists, and ensuring properly trained security forces to help achieve the "just and sustainable peace" the country so badly needs, it said.

Somalia has lacked an effective central government since 1991, with portions of the Horn of Africa nation left lawless.

Its shaky transitional government, backed by African Union peacekeepers, has been battling Islamist guerrillas for years.

CANNES, France (CNN) -- After eleven days, hundreds of screenings and thousands of snaps from the paparazzi, there could only be one Palme d'Or winner.

Austrian director Michael Haneke hugs the president of the Cannes jury, French actress Isabelle Huppert.

"The White Ribbon," by Austrian director Michael Haneke, was awarded the prize for its depiction of the cruel punishments meted out at a rural German school before the First World War.

"The Palme d'Or is the best prize a filmmaker can win," said Haneke at a press conference following his award. "I am not proud, but I am very happy. In my opinion, it's silly to be proud."

It was a case of fifth time lucky for Haneke, who has previously been nominated for the award for "Funny Games" (1997), "Code Unknown" (2000), "The Piano Teacher" (2001) and "Hidden" (2005).

"There are always rumors at the festival, and one must not take them seriously," the director said. "When I presented "Hidden" [in 2005], everyone was telling me I was going to win the Palme. And I didn't get it."

Jury president Isabelle Huppert, the French actress who won the best actress prize at the 2001 festival for "The Piano Teacher," said she was delighted to have the chance to honor her former director.

"I think I always loved him as a director, and that's why I've worked with him before," she said at the post-awards press conference.

"To me, the movie is very philosophical. And his style, and his direction are totally ethical in my mind. That's what I wanted to reward."

The American actress Robin Wright Penn, who also sat on the festival jury, laughed off rumors that the decision was hotly disputed. "There have been rumors circulating that we were fighting in the room," she told the press conference.

"The beauty about loving each other ... [is that] we could disagree, and we still love each other. I felt like we built a consensus among us," she said.

"It was like being on "Big Brother," except you could go to the movies," added British screenwriter and fellow juror Hanif Kureishi. "Some of the films are very long," he joked.

Elsewhere, Charlotte Gainsbourg won the best actress prize for her shocking turn in Lars von Trier's "Antichrist," featuring scenes of genital mutilation that left audiences stunned.

Christolph Waltz won best actor for his role in Quentin Tarantino's "Inglourious Basterds," while Brillante Mendoza secured the best director gong for "Kinatay."

The jury prize was shared by Korean auteur Park Chan-Wook's vampire film "Thirst," and Andrea Arnold's "Fish Tank," while the grand prix went to "The Prophet," by director Jacques Audiard.
(CNN) -- A major investor in convicted swindler Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme drowned in his swimming pool in Florida after a heart attack, his attorney said Monday. The medical examiner's office confirmed the report.

Jeffry Picower, 67, was found unconscious in his pool shortly after noon Sunday at his Palm Beach,  Florida,, home by his wife, Palm Beach police said. He was pronounced dead at Good Samaritan Hospital.

Picower's attorney, William Zabel, told CNN that Picower drowned after suffering a massive heart attack. Sue Jaffe, spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County medical examiner, confirmed those details.

In September, Forbes magazine ranked Picower No. 371 among the 400 richest Americans, with a net worth of $1 billion.

In March, Madoff was convicted of operating a Ponzi scheme and defrauding thousands of investors. He was sentenced to 150 years in prison after pleading guilty to 11 felony counts of fraud, money laundering and perjury. Prosecutors have said it was the largest investor fraud ever committed by a single person, totaling billions in losses to investors.

When the Picower Foundation of Palm Beach announced it was shutting down early this year because of Madoff losses, it initially appeared that the prominent philanthropist had been an unfortunate victim of Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Picower's 2007 tax return had valued his foundation's portfolio at $955 million.

However, in May, court filings by Madoff trustee Irving Picard changed the picture. The trustee's complaint claimed that Picower had been a key beneficiary of Madoff's Ponzi scheme for more than 20 years, and "knew or should have known that [he] was profiting from fraud because of the implausibly high rates of return" on his accounts.

Those "anomalous and astronomical rates of return" -- as high as 500 percent in one year and 950 percent in another year -- "were neither credible nor consistent with legitimate trading activity, and should have caused any reasonable investor ... to inquire further," the court filings said, referring to Picower as "a sophisticated investor, accountant and lawyer."

Citing backdated account filings and other bogus paperwork, the complaint contends that "Picower and the other defendants also knew or should have known that they were reaping the benefits of manipulated purported returns, false documents and fictitious profit."

The Picowers recently told The New York Times that the publicity and controversy surrounding their connection to Bernie Madoff had been a great source of heartache.

"We always have been private people, and having all this play out in the media has taken a big toll on our health," the couple wrote in response to questions posed by reporters.

"We feel stunned, betrayed, angry, sickened, devastated," they said, and were only able to draw strength and consolation "from each other and from the knowledge that we did nothing wrong."
(CNN) -- A severely disfigured woman received the nose, cheeks, upper jaw and facial tissue from a female cadaver in the first near-total face transplant in the United States, the woman's surgeon said Wednesday.

Cleveland Clinic doctors replaced 80 percent of a woman's face two weeks ago in the first such U.S. surgery.

The 22-hour face surgery was completed two weeks ago by a team of eight surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic.

The patient had severe deformity in the middle of her face and was missing her right eye and upper jaw, the Cleveland Clinic doctors said. She could not taste or smell, and she had trouble speaking.

Dr. Maria Siemionow, the head of plastic surgery research at the Cleveland, Ohio, hospital, said many people are "hiding from society because they're afraid to walk to the grocery stores; they're afraid to go to streets because they're called names and humiliated."

"Our patient was called names, and our patient was humiliated," she said. "We very much hope for this special group of patients, there is hope, and one day they will be able to go comfortably from their houses and enjoy the things which we take for granted."

The patient is doing well, the doctors said.  Interactive: More details of the surgery »

Details about the recipient, including her name and age, were withheld at her request.

In the surgery, 80 percent of the woman's face was transplanted. The forehead and chin were left intact.

In this transplant, tissue from the donor's face was shaped and fitted into position. Multiple layers of tissue, bone, muscles and blood vessels, nerve grafts and each artery and vein were connected.  Watch an explanation about face transplants »

"Our hope is she should be able to smile again," said Dr. Frank A. Papay, chairman of the Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Institute at the Cleveland Clinic.

With physical therapy, surgeons hope the patient will regain her ability to smell and blink and will have other facial functions.

Siemionow said the patient never saw a photo of the donor and said, "the donor never looks like the recipient. The recipient never looks like the donor."

Siemionow had medical and ethical clearance for a full facial transplant since 2004. She said it has taken 20 years of research and four years to find the right patient who understood the risks involved.

The doctors' approach from the beginning was to consider "only patients who are the most disfigured" and had "exhausted all existing procedures," Siemionow said.

"This patient exhausted all conventional means of reconstruction and is the right patient," she said.  Watch Dr. Siemionow in the news conference. »

Dr. Eric Kodish, the professor and chairman of the Cleveland Clinic's Department of Bioethics, said doctors thought she would adhere to medications after the surgery.

"This patient had very robust decision-making capacity," he said.

Like with all transplants, there is a risk that the recipient's body could reject the graft. The doctors say they haven't seen any such signs.

The transplant recipient has to take immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of his or her life to prevent rejection of the donated tissue.

In the past three years, facial transplants have been completed in France and China, but these cases have raised medical and ethical questions. Read about the first facial transplant

Some candidates for a face transplant are survivors of trauma, such as burn or accident victims, who have exhausted all other reconstructive possibilities.

The recipient in France, Isabelle Dinoire, had been mauled by a dog, and the Chinese man, Li Guoxing, was attacked by a bear. Both received major facial disfigurements.

In 2007, a French team performed the third partial facial transplant on a man who was disfigured by a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face. Watch a 2006 report about China's first face transplant

Guo Shuzhong, the face transplant doctor who handled Li's case, confirmed to CNN that he died in July of unknown causes. Li last visited the hospital in summer 2007, and he stayed in his hometown in Yunnan province.

The doctor told CNN that Li had a checkup in a small hospital in his hometown three weeks before his death but that no health problems had been found. Watch an ITN report about the Li's case

The facial transplants in France and China generated much controversy as questions arose about whether the patients were adequately vetted and informed about the risks. Those procedures have been "under an ethical cloud," said David Young, a professor of plastic surgery at the University of California, San Francisco.

The current face transplant patient understood the risk of rejection and of immunosuppressants, doctors said.

Criticism of facial transplants

Critics such as Peter A. Clark, director of the Institute of Catholic Bioethics at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said a facial transplant introduces unnecessary risks for a procedure that is not a matter of life and death.

"With something like a liver or kidney transplant, it's a life or death transplant," Clark said. "Even with a kidney or liver [transplant], you have to be put on immunosuppressants with serious side effects."

Bioethicist Dr. Arthur Caplan, chairman of the University of Pennsylvania's Medical Ethics Department, said Wednesday on CNN's "American Morning" that he initially had similar qualms about the facial transplant, which improves the quality of a life rather than saving it, but was gradually convinced.

People with major facial disfigurements "don't come out and basically stay at home and have a huge suicide rate," Caplan said. "They're really up against it."

At the news conference Wednesday, Kodish said the transplant had "abundant moral justification": the face as a personal embodiment as self.

He added that people with disfigurements are often isolated and suffer tremendously and that this case was "not cosmetic surgery in any sense."

Patient's reaction

Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic said that because the patient has limited vision after the surgery, she has yet to see herself.

"At this point she can't see herself but can feel her face," Siemionow said. "She was happy when she could go over her face" and could feel that "she has a nose, she has jaws and has a full face."

After the surgery, the patient was heavily sedated from being on the breathing machine.

As she was slowly awakening, medical staff members asked her how she was feeling and whether she was comfortable.

"She gave a thumbs up, first indication she was comfortable," said Dr. Chad Gordon, a fellow at the clinic's department of plastic surgery. "She has been speaking to us very slightly. Most of communication has been through writing."

Siemionow said the patient will need re-educate her facial motion and need three to six months of nerve regeneration.

(CNN) -- Bolstered by a new poll that shows him leading in Ohio and two other battleground states, President Barack Obama on Wednesday made his ninth campaign trip this year to the Buckeye State to attack Republican rival Mitt Romney's tax plan as unfair to middle-class Americans.

In Ohio, swing state politics have real-life impact

Obama cited a report issued Wednesday by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center that concluded Romney's proposals for tax reform would end up providing large tax cuts to the very wealthy while increasing the tax burden on the lower and middle classes.

"He's asking you to pay more so people like him can get a big tax cut," Obama told more than 2,000 supporters in Mansfield, the first of two Ohio stops Wednesday. "We do not need more tax cuts for folks who are already doing really well."

Romney's campaign challenged the veracity of the study and blamed the president's economic policies for a still-lagging economy.

"President Obama continues to tout liberal studies calling for more tax hikes and more government spending," Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said in a statement. "We've been down that road before -- and it's led us to 41 straight months of unemployment above 8%."

Earlier, the Romney campaign launched a potentially risky ad challenging the Obama administration's auto industry bailout, which is credited with saving General Motors and Chrysler.

Romney Ohio ad hits Obama over auto bailout

With just over three months until the November election, the race has become a contentious struggle to convince voters that the other guy will take the country in the wrong direction.

The Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times poll released Wednesday showed Obama leading Romney in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania, all of which are among the eight or so battleground states vital to either candidate's chances for winning.

Poll: Obama over 50% in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania

According to the survey, Obama holds a 50%-44% lead in Ohio and a 51%-45% lead in Florida, which are considered toss-ups in November. The president is ahead 53%-42% in Pennsylvania, which is rated "leans Obama" on the CNN Electoral Map.

"If today were November 6, President Barack Obama would sweep the key swing states of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania and -- if history is any guide -- into a second term in the Oval Office," wrote Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, in a statement accompanying the survey's release.

In a key finding that signaled possible trouble for Romney, the candidates were statistically even in all three states on the question of who would better handle the economy.

Romney's main campaign theme is that he is more experienced and better able to bring economic growth than Obama, and his attacks on the president's economic policies have been relentless.

Despite those attacks and unemployment above 8%, Obama is neck-and-neck with the former Massachusetts governor on the issue cited by voters as the most important to them.

Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University, said before Wednesday's poll came out that the Romney campaign is "betting on economic dissatisfaction" to defeat Obama.

"If that were true, Obama's negatives would be much worse," Schiller said. "There's obviously something else driving people's support other than the economy."

Obama's visit to Ohio showed the importance his campaign places on the state he won in 2008 over Republican candidate Sen. John McCain.

At events in Mansfield and Akron, Obama delivered a modified version of his usual stump speech emphasizing the need to restore the American dream of equal opportunity for all willing to work for it, adding a section on the report by the Tax Policy Center set up by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.

Study: Romney tax plan would shift burden toward poor

Romney calls for 20% cuts to today's rates as well as eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax and limiting current deductions, exemptions and credits available to top-level income earners.

However, Romney has yet to say which specific tax breaks he plans to eliminate, and the Tax Policy Center report indicated the result of his plan would force the tax burden to shift toward lower- and middle-class Americans.

Tax policy has become a central economic issue, with Congress deadlocked over proposals to extend most or all of the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year.

Obama calls for extending the current rates under the tax cuts for income below $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals, while letting the rates on income above those figures rise to 1990s levels.

"If you're fortunate enough to be in the other 2% of Americans, all we're asking you to do is contribute a little more," Obama said Wednesday. "This includes me, by the way."

Romney and Republicans want to extend all the Bush tax cuts for now to prevent any increase, with both sides calling for comprehensive tax reform after the election as part of necessary deficit reduction steps.

The issue touches on the foundations of the nation's political divide, with Republicans driven by their conservative base seeking to shrink government to reduce deficits while Democrats want a blend of spending cuts and more tax revenue in order to maintain what they consider essential services and entitlement programs.

In its study, the Tax Policy Center did not score Romney's plan directly, saying it lacked sufficient details. Instead, the center said Romney's plan represented a number of Republican proposals.

"They found that if Gov. Romney wants to keep his word and pay for his plan, then he'd have to cut tax breaks that middle-class families depend on," Obama said, listing mortgage deductions and health care deductions as examples. "That means the average middle-class family with children would be hit with a tax increase of more than $2,000."

The president made clear that he was relying on the study for the analysis and details, saying, "this wasn't my staff; this wasn't something we did."

"Folks making more than $3 million, the top one-tenth of one percent, would get a tax cut of a quarter of a million a year. Think about that," Obama said.

The Romney campaign argued that the analysis was flawed because it did not account for additional revenue that would result from a reduction in the corporate tax rate -- another part of Romney's plan.

"Ignoring the growth effects of corporate tax reform discredits the Tax Policy Center immediately," a Romney campaign representative said, adding, "By not including the substantial growth effects of the corporate side (of) reforms, the entire study is based on flawed assumptions."

Also on Wednesday, the Romney campaign released a television ad that criticized Obama for the auto bailout. Titled "Dream," the spot features Al Zarzour, a car dealership owner from Lyndhurst, Ohio, saying that under the bailout measure, "the dream ... that we worked so hard for was gone."

"I received a letter from General Motors. They were suspending my credit line. We had 30-some employees that were out of work," Zarzour says in the spot.

Romney has argued the bailout was not the best solution to right the then-struggling auto industry, instead advocating a "managed bankruptcy" process that he said is what ultimately happened.

Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, said the Romney ad was surprising, adding that the president's actions on the auto industry saved 2,200 dealership jobs in Ohio alone.

Obama's campaign has also aired advertisements focused on the auto industry bailout, including one in which an autoworker explains how the bailout helped him.

Romney and the Republican National Committee have paid $8.2 million for a week of ad time in eight battleground states, which a Republican source who tracks ad buys called the largest amount spent on behalf of Romney so far in the general election media campaign.

Romney, RNC make largest weekly ad buy

Last week, the RNC started spending some of the funds it is allowed to use to coordinate with the Romney campaign. This allows Romney's campaign to avoid spending some of its money but stay on the air as the candidate faces millions of dollars of ads from the Obama re-election campaign.

Romney campaign officials have routinely refused to discuss the specifics of its ad spending or where its commercials are running.

According to CNN's ad consultant Campaign Media Analysis Group/Kantar Media, the Romney ad talking about layoffs in the car industry is running in Ohio while a new biography spot with Romney touting his business background is up in Iowa.

The Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee, which started coordinating ad spending last week as well, bought $5.3 million of ad time in the same eight states between July 21 and August 3, and a separate $3.5 million for commercials running for a week ending August 2.

Another new Romney ad Wednesday hammered Obama over unemployment and other economic problems, saying: "Americans need a change. We need a new president."

Obama's campaign responded to the ad by citing Romney's opposition to the auto industry bailout.

"Let's get this straight -- the very person who argued for the U.S. auto industry to go bankrupt, something that would have caused more than a million jobs lost and utter economic devastation in the Midwest, is now trying to attack the president on how it was handled?" campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith said in a written statement.

Washington (CNN) -- Ten years after the September 11th attacks, the nation still isn't fully prepared to handle another huge disaster, Lee Hamilton, one of the co-chairmen of the 9/11 Commission, said Thursday.

First responders could still have problems communicating with one another, and there is confusion in some communities about who would be in charge, Hamilton told the House Homeland Security Committee. He urged quick action to solve the problems.

"We cannot permit delay of this," he said. "We lost lives at 9/11. We lost lives at Katrina because we were not able to get communication."

The 9/11 Commission recommended concerted action to fix the problem of responder communications, but the problem persists. "I think it's an urgent question and shame on us, shame on us if we have not solved this problem when the next disaster strikes," Hamilton said.

Tom Ridge, the first secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said competing measures to deal with the problem are being considered by the House and Senate, while police and fire departments are waiting for some kind of action.

"All they want is a system," Ridge said, "... the opportunity to get voice and data and video over the broadband" in the event of a terror attack, natural disaster or major accident.

The committee's chairman, Rep Peter King, R-New York, said he continues to believe the answer is to set aside a block of wireless telecommunication bands for an emergency communications network.

Hamilton said another concern is knowing who is in charge in the event of a disaster. He called it a "no-brainer" but added that in metropolitan areas, where many law enforcement and rescue groups would respond in a big emergency, the lines of command are not defined.

King held the hearing to assess what progress has been made since the 2001 terror attacks and what still needs to be done. He pointed the finger at Congress -- where he serves -- for not streamlining congressional oversight of the Department of Homeland Security.

"We're sending mixed signals as far as what Congress wants in the area of homeland security, and this fragmentation, to me, is inviting, if not disaster, certainly it's preventing law enforcement and the intelligence agencies from doing the job to the maximum," King said.

Hamilton also said the Transportation Security Administration and other entities have done a great deal of work on technology to detect all types of explosives but "we have to accelerate our efforts" to be able to find bomb materials people carry or could hide inside their bodies.

Ridge said the United States has been able to thwart many terror plots, but in some instances it was because the bombers made mistakes and were ineffective. "Luck is not a strategy," he said, warning that the United States must adapt to detect the evolving tactics of terrorists.

Hamilton told the panel much progress has been made in the past 10 years, but more needs to be done: "We are safer today, but not as safe as we could be."
Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- The Australian editor of a Myanmar newspaper was ordered to remain in jail after a court hearing in Yangon Thursday.

Officials revealed at the hearing that Ross Dunkley, the editor of the Myanmar Times, faces charges related to torturing and drugging a woman.

Dunkley was arrested in early February. At the time, authorities said he faced immigration charges.

At the hearing Thursday, authorities added the drug and torture charges stating that Myanmar law dictates that any foreigner who faces criminal charges always faces additional immigration charges.

The woman making the allegations against Dunkley was at the hearing, and said the editor gave her a drug on two occasions that hampered her memory. On the second time, the woman said she jumped out of Dunkley's car to escape.

Dunkley denied all charges and requested to be released on bond, which was denied.

But in a strange twist, the woman told the judge that she wanted to drop her allegations and withdraw the case.

"The woman who had made allegations of physical assault against Mr. Dunkley told the court that she wanted to withdraw her complaint," David Armstrong, chairman of Post Media Ltd. and a friend of Dunkley's who is serving as his spokesman, said in a statement. "She admitted that she made allegations during the hearing that she had not made in her initial police interview."

A judge asked her to consider her request and scheduled another hearing for March 3.

Officials from the Australian Embassy in Myanmar attended the hearing, Armstrong said.

Myanmar Times is one of a few newspapers owned and run by a foreigner in the nation. Dunkley's arrest comes amid a business dispute with the paper's local partner.

"I cannot say for sure that the cause behind Ross' arrest was driven by business dispute because I was not with him in Myanmar," said Armstrong. "But what I can say, all the troubles came to Ross at an odd timing as there was a business negotiation with his local partner going on."
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There is "no remaining hope" of finding six men trapped for almost a month in a Utah coal mine alive, a federal official said Saturday.

Isaac Arellano holds a candle and sings during a fundraiser for miners Tuesday in Price, Utah.

"Over the past 25 days, the Mine Safety and Health Administration has exhausted all known options in our attempt to reach the six miners," Richard Stickler, head of the agency, said in a statement.

"The thoughts and prayers of the dedicated professionals at MSHA are with the families."

Sympathy for the failed efforts also came Saturday from the White House.

"Last night, a difficult decision was made to end the search," President Bush said in a statement. "Laura and I are deeply saddened by this tragedy and continue to pray for the families of these men."

Labor Secretary Elaine Chao called the ordeal "heartbreaking."

"The grueling around-the-clock rescue operation that claimed three lives and injured six others has also taken a tremendous toll on the many brave rescuers and the local community, and our thoughts and prayers are with them all," Chao said in a statement.

After drilling seven holes into mine tunnels from the mountaintop above, there has been no sign of the miners -- and microphones have picked up no sound from the men.  See a timeline of rescue efforts »

Tests showed underground oxygen levels were too low to sustain human life.

"We basically told the families that at this point in time we've run out of options," Stickler said at a news conference late Friday.

"We've consulted with the people that we have here, we've consulted with the technical support in Pittsburgh and we've consulted with private consultants in terms of where we can go," he said.

"And basically, through all the information we've gleaned over the past nearly four weeks in terms of the conditions we found, in terms of the air readings we found down there and ... everything else, we just don't know where else we can put a hole to get any other information."

There were no public statements Saturday from Bob Murray, president and CEO of Murray Mining, co-owner of the Crandall Canyon Mine, who was the outspoken face of the rescue operation for the first three weeks, then largely disappeared from public view.

Federal officials became the spokesmen. No one from Murray Mining was present at Friday's news conference.

"They are done. It's finished," the attorney for the families said, according to the Saturday edition of The Salt Lake Tribune.

"It's a hard and bitter pill for our families, and there were quite a few tears shed," the newspaper quotes Colin King as saying.

The men were trapped during a collapse on August 6, and it is not known whether they survived the cave-in.

Efforts to reach them were suspended 10 days later when two rescuers and a federal mining official were killed, and six people were injured in a second collapse as they tried to tunnel horizontally toward the area where the men had been working.

Murray said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were found at the sixth hole.

Under pressure from the families, however, he agreed to try one more time. Families wanted officials to drill a hole large enough to send down a rescue capsule.

The effort to lower the robotic device down a seventh hole had been called "a long shot" by an official.

MSHA's Stickler said that hole was drilled into the Crandall Canyon Mine on Thursday, but there were problems with a robotic camera that teams were trying to lower into it.

Work resumed Friday, this time at the fourth hole, but the camera could only descend about 7 feet, he said.

"Basically, what it saw was really not that much. There was quite a bit of mud in there, water coming down the hole. It really couldn't go any farther than seven feet," he said of the latest try. In addition, the roof was sagging.

"The families asked many, many questions and we answered them all the best we could, basically coming to the conclusion that we had run out of options."

Murray said last Saturday he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Crandall Canyon mine.

"I will never come back to that evil mountain," he said.

Friends and family have identified the six missing miners as Luis Hernandez, Manuel Sanchez, Kerry Allred, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips and Don Erickson. E-mail to a friend
The biennial Dubai Airshow began Sunday with the Gulf region's major carriers announcing some of the biggest aviation deals in history.

There was as much speculation swirling around the size of the orders before the event as there was desert sand outside the nearby Al Maktoum airport.

However few predicted that $192.3 billion worth of deals for commercial jets (at list prices) would be announced on the first day -- a new record that has outstripped the orders from the entire 2007 airshow.

The region's three big players -- Etihad, Emirates and Qatar Airways -- announced orders for 393 new commercial planes. Boeing and Airbus shared the spoils, with high demand for the 777X, Boeing's next-generation version of the existing 777.

The Abu Dhabi based airline Etihad was the first to lay down a marker at the event: a $25.2B deal for 56 new wide-bodied Boeing aircraft, including 25 777X planes, 17 of the biggest 777-9X variants and eight of the 777-8X version.

"This order enables us to build upon our achievements, using the next generation of aircraft to support our next generation of development," said Etihad CEO James Hogan. "This order is for 2018 out to 2025/2030. The traffic is there."

Later Hogan trumped his Boeing order with an announcement for 87 Airbus jets worth $26.9B at list price, including 50 A350 aircraft, the twin-aisle competitor of the 777X currently in development.

The airline is also set to be the biggest operator of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, with a new order for 30 of the new planes to add its current deal for 41 of the composite, medium to long-distance jets.

But it was Dubai's Emirates that revealed the largest order with a $76B deal  for 150 Boeing 777X planes, plus an additional 50 Airbus A380s, worth $23 billion, to bring its order of the superjumbo up to 101. The airline currently operates 39 of the world's largest commercial jet.

Low-cost carrier FlyDubai committed to purchasing 111 Boeing 737 jets worth $11.4B.

Doha-based Qatar Airlines added to the impressive figures for Boeing's 777X with a $19B order for 50 of the aircraft. Lufthansa will be the forth "launch airline" to receive the new model jet when delivery begins from 2020 onwards. It has 34 on order.

The aircraft is the latest iteration of the company's 777 series and will be manufactured with all new composite material wings. With a wingspan of 71 meters, the 777-9X is greater than the 747-800.

"With around $100B worth of orders, this makes it the largest aviation product launch," said Boeing Chairman and CEO Jim McNeary. "We look forward to ... continuing to support Dubai's expansion into a global aviation hub."

Finding room for the new aircraft in Dubai should not be a problem as the Al-Maktoum airport is the city's second international hub and predicted to be the world's largest when completed. Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum was at the show and supportive of the new airport and mega deals.

"We cannot operate from one airport with all these planes," he told CNN's John Defterios after the Emirate's announcement.

"The passengers are growing so much and a lot of people are coming and going from here to America, to Europe and Asia. So Emirates has to be strong and so does FlyDubai."

Hogan predicts passenger numbers for Etihad to grow by 14% annually for the next five years, while Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, Emirates' CEO, believes the numbers will come as more countries open up.

"We don't want anything below double digital growth in passenger numbers," he said. "Some countries may be scared (to open up their markets), but they really have to open up."
(CNN) -- Over 1.8 million gallons of dispersant chemicals have been added to the Gulf of Mexico to break up oil flowing from the Deepwater Horizon's ruptured well. And in the 100 days since the rig's explosion, little more has become known about the effects of those chemicals.

In May, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Coast Guard directed BP to use a less toxic dispersant than the one it was putting into the Gulf, Corexit 9500. When the company did not comply, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson announced that the EPA would run its own toxicity tests, the first round of which focused on Corexit 9500 and seven other common, readily available dispersants from the agency's approved list.

The tests showed Corexit to be slightly less toxic than the manufacturer's data had indicated, so no new orders were issued.

"We need more data before we decide whether to change dispersants," said Paul T. Anastas, the EPA's assistant administrator for research and development. "Our ultimate goal in all of this is to reach a point where dispersants are no longer necessary."

Scientists say questions remain about the effects of dispersants, in particular the more subtle consequences.

"The only effect that's being looked [in acute toxicity tests] at is death, lethality. That is a place that testing often starts because you want to know what concentration of the chemical will kill fish or other organisms," said Richard Denison, senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund. "But what's much more relevant in predicting the full effects of the use of dispersants and dispersed oil are the more subtle effects -- that are sublethal, that may affect growth and reproduction."

Those sublethal effects may cause a population to diminish without necessarily killing organisms. Larvae and eggs are most at risk because they are more sensitive and less mobile.

As for human health, scientists say much more needs to be learned about dispersants -- their behavior with oil, chemical ingredients, chronic and delayed effects -- to understand the risks.

There are two types of potential exposures for humans, according to scientists: direct (by inhalation, ingestion or absorption through the skin) and indirect (by eating seafood). According to toxicologist Dr. LuAnn White of Tulane University, the risk to most humans is very low because the oil-dispersant mixture dilutes quickly and does not build up in the food chain.

Some scientists disagree over dispersants' ability to break down the oil faster than it would naturally decompose.

"The conventional wisdom is that by breaking up oil into small droplets, it may be more easily biodegraded. That is not firmly established. In fact, there are conflicting data," said Denison. "Some studies suggest that the rate of degradation of PAHs [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a breakdown product of oil] is actually impeded by dispersants." Another unknown is whether the chemical constituents of oil are more or less likely to persist in the food chain.

"The problem has been that we have simply not required the answers to those questions. The fact that they are being asked now, and we don't have answers, is of particular concern given the magnitude and scale of use of dispersant."

According to Denison, more information is needed in order "to be able to intelligently answer questions of whether we should still be using the dispersants."

"I am not of the view that [dispersant] should or should not be used. I don't think we have enough data to answer those questions very well, and I'm hoping that this tragedy will spur us to answer those questions so we'll have enough information next time."
Silverstone, England (CNN) -- It has taken over 20 years, but a woman was back on the track in the male-dominated world of Formula One .

Unfortunately not for very long.

Susie Wolff became the first female since 1992 to take part in an F1 weekend, but after just four laps at Friday's British Grand Prix practice session the 31-year-old Scot had to retire because of an oil pressure problem.

"It was a really tough day," a dejected Wolff told reporters at the historic Silverstone circuit, after her stricken car was hoisted back to the pits. "But that's F1 sometimes.

"Although there has been a lot of media around my run, when it's just you in the car it's the best feeling.

"I felt very ready for today -- I knew in my head what I had to do, it was good to get that first run of a race weekend in the bag."

Wolff's best time of one minute and 44.212 seconds was set at the very start of the session and was not representative of her ultimate pace.

Claire Williams -- deputy team principal of her father's eponymous race team and another strong female role model in the sport -- explained the team did not need to judge Wolff's driving abilities during her practice debut.

"That was heartbreaking really," said Williams. "The rest of the team are so disappointed for Susie as she's put in so much effort and hard work and she's been subjected to so much scrutiny.

"It was nothing that she did, it was an issue with the car that we are investigating."

Williams' deputy team principal praised Wolff for her diligence ahead of the session.

"We don't have a question mark over her," Williams told the media. "We're not running her to see how good she is, that's not what we're doing.

"She knows the car, she's done a lot of preparation in the simulator, she's spent a lot of time with the engineers and she's perfectly competent in the car without causing any hindrance to the team.

"She goes out there with her peers in a competitive situation."

Wolff, who competed for six years in the popular German touring car championship before joining F1, has been up against it both on and off the track.

As the wife of Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff, who also owns just over 10% of the Williams team, she has had to bat away suggestions that she owes her opportunity behind the wheel to nepotism.

"I've always said he's my biggest supporter and also my biggest critic," said Wolff at Silverstone.

"He knew I had to go out there and do a good job today. He's also quite sad that I didn't get the chance to show it. He would have loved it if I'd have done the session and done a good job."

Williams' deputy team principal has also had to deny employing Wolff as the team's development driver was just a publicity stunt.

"It would be naive to say that having a female on board doesn't bring you commercial benefit but everybody knows that Williams is a serious racing team," she said.

"We're not only going to do something because it's a marketing gimmick or could bring us in a load of dollars.

"Susie hasn't bought in those dollars and we haven't had any expectation that she would. She has to deliver technically which she's done."

There was also support for Wolff from her British peers at Silverstone -- former world champions Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button.

"She's very, very talented," said Mercedes driver Hamilton, who raced against her in his junior career in karting and Formula Renault. "It's really cool to see her in a Formula One car.

"I didn't race against many girls. Susie was one of the very few, if not the only one, I raced against. We shared a podium together a couple of times."

McLaren's Button added: "She's already driven in a test this year and went very well. It'll be good to see her on track."

Wolff will get a second chance to make her mark in first practice at the next grand prix in Germany.

"I've still got one more shot at it," said the 31-year-old Wolff. "So, head up high and look forward to Hockenheim.

"I didn't prove or show anything today. I really want to use that opportunity to show what I can do.

"To get into an F1 car is so difficult that you want to maximize it."

Asked why it had taken more than 20 years for a female racer to be given another opportunity in a competitive F1 session, Wolff told CNN: "Firstly, if there is no role model out there doing it, for all the little girls who come to the tracks and watch on TV, if they don't see a girl on track then they're not inspired to want to do that themselves.

"That then leads to the second problem that there's not enough girls karting or starting at a young age.

"But sometimes in life you just need a chance, and I got that chance with the Williams team -- Frank and Claire gave me that big break."

Williams -- who grew up in motorsport's macho environment -- told CNN: "I'm always a believer that it's up to individuals to come up and do it and that hasn't happened for whatever reason."

Giovanna Amati was the last woman to drive in the sport when she attempted to qualify for a race in 1992.

The Italian was competing in an era of F1 when there were only 26 spots on the grid and more than 30 cars pushing for those places.

Amati, driving for the Brabham team, attempted to qualify at three races but was not able to break through with a largely uncompetitive car.

Of the seven women to join the F1 world championship, only two have ever qualified to start a race.

The most prolific of these was Italian Lella Lombardi, who started 12 grands prix in the 1970s.

Lombardi made history while driving with March at a difficult 1975 Spanish Grand Prix, becoming the only woman to register a point-scoring finish in a grand prix.

The late Maria de Villota, who died in October last year, also began her F1 career along with Wolff when she was signed as a development driver by the Marussia team in 2012.
(CNN)The "Fifty Shades" series will have to handcuff a new director.

Sam Taylor-Johnson, who directed "Fifty Shades of Grey," told Deadline.com that she won't be back for the sequel, "Fifty Shades Darker."

"Directing 'Fifty Shades Of Grey' has been an intense and incredible journey for which I am hugely grateful," she said in a statement to the site. "While I will not be returning to direct the sequels, I wish nothing but success to whosoever takes on the exciting challenges of films two and three."

'Fifty Shades of Grey': What fans hoped for?

The first film in the best-selling book series has been hugely successful, pulling in more than $550 million worldwide since it premiered in mid-February, but there have been rumbles that creative clashes were in the offing for the sequel.

Author E L James has a great deal of control in how her books are presented on screen, and she made it clear that she wanted to write the screenplay for the second film, Variety reported last month.

Kelly Marcel wrote the screenplay for "Fifty Shades of Grey."

The story behind Mr. Grey's suits

The film stars Jamie Dornan as billionaire Christian Grey -- a man of certain sexual proclivities -- and Dakota Johnson as his romantic partner, Anastasia Steele.
(CNN) -- The U.S. Agriculture Department cited drought and heat on Wednesday in designating 597 counties in 14 states as primary natural disaster areas.

"As drought persists, USDA will continue to partner with producers to see them through longer-term recovery, while taking the swift actions needed to help farmers and ranchers prepare their land and operations for the upcoming planting season," Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.

The designations make qualified farmers in the areas eligible for low-interest loans, the agency said.

Affected counties have suffered severe drought for eight consecutive weeks, which qualified them for the automatic designation.

Richard Oswald, a 62-year-old farmer in Missouri's Atchison County, said he has been hit hard by the drought but was not sure whether he would take advantage of the drought designation for his county by getting a low-interest loan.

"The hay situation is not good; the pastures burned up early because of the heat and lack of rain," said Oswald, who was born on a farm and has been farming since he was a teenager. "This is the worst drought that I have ever seen. An emergency loan is great, but it's still borrowed money, and as a farmer, that's not good because you have to pay it back."

Chad Breiner of Wabaunsee County, Kansas, said the drought has affected his bull-selling business because he uses grass for feed and has to buy hay.

"The fact that it hasn't rained significantly since June is going to make 2013 look rather bleak because the ponds are low, the creeks are low, and without adequate moisture in the next few months when grazing comes up, our production is going to be significantly less than normal," he said.

Last year, the USDA designated 2,245 counties in 39 states, or 71 percent of the United States, as disaster areas due to drought.

Australians battle wildfires

Wednesday's announcement comes a day after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that 2012 had been the hottest year on record for the continental United States and the second-worst for "extreme" weather such as hurricanes, droughts or floods.

The year's average temperature of 55.3 degrees Fahrenheit across the "Lower 48" was more than 3.2 degrees warmer than the average for the 20th century, NOAA reported. That topped the previous record, set in 1998, by a full degree.

Drought shriveled crops across the farm belt, leading to an expected rise in food prices in 2013, according to USDA. It also turned forests of the mountain West into tinder stands that exploded into wildfires over the summer, scorching millions of acres and destroying hundreds of homes.

Seven of the 10 hottest years on U.S. record, which date to 1895, and four of the hottest five have occurred since 1990, according to NOAA.

Rough winter weather hits Middle East

The year also saw Arctic sea ice hit a record low in more than 30 years of satellite observations and studies that found the world's major ice sheets have been shrinking at an increasing rate.

Scientists are quick to point out that no single storm can be blamed on climate change, but say a warming world raises the odds of extreme weather.

"I think, unfortunately, 2012 really may well be the new normal," said Daniel Lashof, director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a U.S. environmental group. "It's the kind of year we expect, given the global warming trend is ongoing."

The science of global warming is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most researchers, who point to heat-trapping carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels as the major cause.

(CNN) -- August 20, 2010

Swedish prosecutors issue an arrest warrant for Julian Assange amid allegations of rape and molestation from two female Wikileaks volunteers earlier that month. The next day, the prosecutor's office announces it is rescinding the arrest warrant while the rape charge is unfounded. The molestation allegation remains.

August 31, 2010

Assange is questioned by Stockholm police and formally told of the charges against him, all of which he denies as a smear campaign. Swedish prosecutors announce the next day that they are reopening the rape case against him, while the molestation charge will be upgraded to sexual coercion and sexual molestation.

November 18, 2010

Swedish prosecutors announce the courts have approved their request to issue arrest warrants to question Assange, who is now in London. On November 20, the Stockholm Criminal Court issues an international arrest warrant for Assange, stating he is suspected of several counts of rape, sexual molestation and illegal use of force. Interpol later issues a "red notice" upon Sweden's request.

December 8, 2010

Assange turns himself in to London police. He is remanded in custody after an extradition hearing finds him a flight risk. On December 16, the court finalizes its decision to grant him conditional bail. Celebrity supporters rally around him, paying his Â£240,000 ($376,000) bail and providing a mansion for his house arrest.

February 7- 24, 2011

Assange attends extradition hearings at London's Belmarsh Magistrate's Court, which ultimately rules in support of his extradition to Sweden. Assange then launches an appeal at the High Court.

November 2, 2011

After a series of hearings in July, the British High Court defers its decision until November, ultimately ruling against Assange's appeal. Assange has two weeks to seek the court's permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.

December 5, 2011

The High Court announces that Assange will be allowed to appeal its decision on the legal technicality of whether the Swedish public prosecutor is a judicial authority, a status needed to sign an arrest warrant. The case now moves to the Supreme Court, Britain's highest judicial authority.

May 30, 2012

The Supreme Court denies Assange's appeal against his extradition to Sweden, but in an unusual move, grants him permission to file an appeal. On June 14, it dismisses his application to reopen his appeal.

June 19, 2012

Assange flees to Ecuador's embassy in London to request political asylum. London police say he is subject to arrest for breaking the terms of his bail by seeking asylum.

August 15, 2012

Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Patino, says his government will announce its decision on Assange's asylum request the next day. He says Ecuador received written notice from British authorities that they would "assault" the country's embassy in London if Assange was not handed over.

August 16, 2012

Ecuador announces it has granted asylum to Assange because it believes he will be politically persecuted if extradited. The UK says it is disappointed by the decision and will not grant safe passage out of the country to Assange, who has now been holed up inside Ecuador's embassy in London for nearly two months.
T.J. Lane, a remorseless killer who escaped from an Ohio prison where he was serving three life sentences for a school shooting, has been captured.

For six long hours, police scoured neighborhoods on the north end of Lima, Ohio, asking residents to lock their doors and stay inside.

They brought in extra officers and provided patrols to the families of Lane's victims.

In the end, he was found 100 yards away outside a church, the prison warden said. He didn't say anything, nor did he put up a fight, authorities said.

Lane was serving consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole for his attack at Chardon High School on February 27, 2012.

He walked in to the school cafeteria with a .22-caliber gun and randomly started shooting.  He fired 10 rounds, killing three students.

The 19-year-old scaled a fence at the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima, about 90 miles northwest of Columbus, Warden Kevin Jones said.

"He wasn't in the maximum-security facility. That is something we have to sit down and take a look at."

Lane escaped, along with two other men, about 7:40 p.m. Thursday.

He was back in custody about shortly after 1 a.m. Friday.

"You never plan on someone escaping and certainly someone of that notoriety, you would think that they would take special precautions to prevent this," Ian Friedman, who represented him at his trial, said late Thursday.

"This was a huge case here in Ohio.  So, everyone in Ohio is shocked right now."

Friends, family remember Ohio school shooting victims

Prison infractions

The Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution houses about 1,600 inmates guarded by 257 security personnel.

A Correctional Institution Inspection Committee report in April said the facility was over capacity by 217 inmates. In addition, the number of inmate assaults on staff increased by 60.7% last year, compared with 2012. No escapes were mentioned in the report.

In the 18 months he's been there, Lane was disciplined seven times, according to The Plain Dealer newspaper.

The infractions ranged from urinating on a wall to giving himself a tattoo, the paper said.

Lane escaped with Clifford E. Opperud, 45, who was serving time for aggravated robbery, and another man. All three have been captured.

Chardon is about 190 miles away from Lima.

"We're upset this happened," said Ron Parmetor, whose nephew Daniel Parmetor, 16,  was one of Lane's victims.

Parmetor says he wants answers; how could Lane just escape?

The other two victims were Demetrius Hewlin, 16, and Russell King Jr., 17.

Chardon schools will be closed Friday, but counselors and other support services will be provided, the school district superintendent said.

Community shaken

Chardon is a community of 5,100 people, some 30 miles east of Cleveland.

It was shaken by the shooting at the high school, and further traumatized by Lane's behavior in court.

Lane pleaded guilty last year to three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and weapons-related charges. But he never offered an explanation.

He was sentenced to consecutive sentences of life without parole and additional sentences totaling 37 years.

At the sentencing hearing, Lane unbuttoned his blue dress shirt to reveal a white T-shirt on which he had scrawled the word "KILLER" across the front. He had on a similar shirt during his shooting rampage.

Before the sentencing, he addressed the victims' families using profane imagery and ending with the expletive, "F--- all of you."

He then held up his middle finger.

"For everyone in that courtroom -- the victims, their families, the prosecutors, defense -- everyone in that courtroom was just absolutely taken aback," said Friedman, who hasn't talked to Lane in about a year. "There was no way to fully comprehend what happened in the courtroom that afternoon."

T.J. Lane tightlipped about motive, escape

Ohio school shooter shows contempt, no remorse during sentencing
(CNN) -- Is the much-loved Piaggio Vespa more iconic than the floppy disk? Is the iPod more of a design classic than the Airbus A380?

These are the questions we put to some of the world's greatest designers when we asked them to nominate what they believe to be the most iconic industrial design from the last 100 years.

This Saturday, the international design community will celebrate World Industrial Design Day. To mark the event, CNN spoke to Gianfranco Zaccai, CEO of global design and innovation consultancy Continuum. Zaccai and his team have been behind some of the most well-known products of the last three decades -- including the iconic Reebok Pump -- and have worked with brands including American Express, PepsiCo and Samsung.

CNN asked the celebrated innovator about his views on what constitutes good design at the turn of the millennium. What do you think are the most iconic designs from the last 100 years? Let us know in the comments section below.

CNN: What are the three most important principles of good product design?

Gianfranco Zaccai (GZ): I think these three principles apply to not just product design, but good design in general:

1. Empathy: empathy is a realization that you are not designing for yourself but for others. You have to get into the lives of the people who will use it.

2. Pragmatism: realize there are some things you have to deal with to fulfill this type of product or service. It has to fulfill the performance requirement, it has to be cost effective and it has to be producible -- all things you can quantify.

3. Passion: if you just stop at what you can quantify and measure you haven't gone far enough. Think about a great meal you have had. It's not just the ingredients that make it great, but the creativity and sensitivity of cook that makes it special.

CNN: How do you keep the spirit of innovation in your company alive?

GZ: First and foremost it's about hiring really good, talented people who think holistically about understanding people's lives and then solving problems in a rational and emotional way. It's about surrounding yourself with people with different skill sets and sensibilities where they stimulate and inform each other. The best outcomes come from bringing two or more sensibilities together and the end result is more than the sum of the two people.

CNN: What's the best way for an amateur designer to turn a great idea into a reality?

GZ: In my mind, there are no amateur designers. They love what they do, they just may not be getting paid for it yet. There are lots of different people who didn't study engineering or design who come up with great ideas. The important thing is for them to step outside of themselves and understand what they are sensing may be reflective of a broader need. They should see what they can perceive about a certain context and come back and re-look at their idea.

Then it is time to take it further. Don't be afraid to share it with others who can help make it stronger. The most difficult thing about vetting new ideas is knowing which idea is truly great and which one of those are truly deployable, and then making it real by addressing all of the functional, emotional and cost issues.

And lastly, having the perseverance to overcome the organizational obstacles in getting that innovation into a socioeconomic system where it can be disseminated and revenue generating. You have to be able to see the opportunity, develop it, support it and promote it and, almost always, you need creative partners to do all of it. To be the innovator and champion of the original vision is where the passion of an amateur comes in.

CNN: How does the environment you work in affect creativity?

GZ: An environment is important but it's not just one environment or office that fosters creativity. We allow people to work in different ways. Some space allows our team to work where they can be introspective and concentrate deeply and others that are more collaborative and allows them to interact with others both physically and virtually.

CNN: Is product design a science or an art?

GZ: It's neither science nor art but some of both. Design tries to leverage scientific and technological opportunities and limitations with an understanding of human beings and their psychological, social, and cultural context. Design is about identifying real needs and desires; solving problems while connecting with people emotionally. Design is about making a positive difference in people lives, which they embrace because of the holistic value it provides. It's functional, fun, enjoyable, uplifting and sustainable.

CNN: What are the most common mistakes people make when designing a new product?

GZ: I think the most common mistake that people make when designing something new is not really understanding the true issues and thinking that design is all about aesthetics.

CNN: What's the best piece of advice anyone has ever given you?

GZ: "You don't know what you don't know." A young engineer said that to me once and it's really true. The idea of not starting off anything as "the expert", even if you happen to know a lot about it, is a good way to create new paradigms and not just repeat the past.
(CNN) -- The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history continues to plague West Africa as leaders scramble to stop the virus from spreading.

Over the weekend, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf closed most of the country's borders. The few points of entry that are still open will have Ebola testing centers and will implement preventive measures, she said. The president also placed restrictions on public gatherings and ordered hotels, restaurants and other entertainment venues to play a five-minute video on Ebola safety.

"No doubt the Ebola virus is a national health problem," Sirleaf said. "It attacks our way of life, with serious economic and social consequences. As such we are compelled to bring the totality of our national resolve to fight this scourge."

As of July 20, the World Health Organization had confirmed 224 cases of Ebola in Liberia, including 127 deaths. Overall, Ebola has killed at least 660 people in West Africa. There were 45 new cases reported in the region between July 18 and July 20.

Ebola: Fast Facts

Health officials are worried about the virus spreading to other countries in the region. This is the first such outbreak to hit West Africa. On Friday, a Liberian man with Ebola died in Lagos, Nigeria, Nigerian Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu said.

Patrick Sawyer arrived at Lagos' airport on July 20 and was isolated at a local hospital after exhibiting common Ebola symptoms. He told officials he had no direct contact with anyone who had the virus.

Lagos State Health Commissioner Dr. Jide Idris said authorities are working to identify people who may have come in contact with the man on his flights. The process has been delayed, he said, because the airline has not provided the passenger lists for all three of the flights Sawyer took. Sawyer flew first to Ghana before he went to Togo and then switched planes to fly to Nigeria, according to the health commissioner.

"In collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Aviation, I've also put into motion mechanisms to track down all contacts at high risk," Idris said.

The state department has identified 59 people so far who came into contact with the man. Twenty have been tested for Ebola.

On Monday, Arik Air, one of Nigeria's biggest airlines, suspended operations into the country's capital, Monrovia, and another city called Freetown, according to AllAfrica.com.

It is unlikely the virus would spread on a plane unless a passenger were to come into contact with a sick person's bodily fluids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Meanwhile, American health care workers helping to fight this deadly disease abroad have put themselves at risk.

Dr. Kent Brantly, a 33-year-old Indianapolis resident, had been treating Ebola patients in Monrovia when he started to feel sick.

Brantly works with Samaritan's Purse, a Christian international relief agency founded by evangelists Franklin Graham and Robert Pierce. He has been the medical director for the Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia and has been working to help Ebola patients since October.

Deadliest ever outbreak: what you need to know

"When the Ebola outbreak hit, he took on responsibilities with our Ebola direct clinical treatment response, but he was serving in a missionary hospital in Liberia prior to his work with Ebola patients," said Melissa Strickland, a spokeswoman for the organization.

After testing positive for Ebola, he went into treatment at a Samaritan's Purse isolation center at ELWA Hospital in Paynesville City, Monrovia. His condition is rapidly deteriorating and Samaritan's Purse has been working to evacuate him for better care, but Liberia is not allowing the evacuation, according to Samaritan's Purse vice president of international relief, Ken Isaacs. The reason for the delay is unclear.

The CDC said the doctor's family had been with him, but left for the United States before he became symptomatic; as such it is highly unlikely that they caught the virus from him. Out of an abundance of caution they are on a 21-day fever watch, the CDC said.

Another American working with Samaritan's Purse has also been infected. Nancy Writebol from Charlotte, North Carolina, works with Serving in Mission, or SIM. She and her husband used to work with orphans and other children who struggle with poverty-related issues but expanded their efforts to take on the complex medical problems in Monrovia.

She had teamed up with the staff from Samaritan's Purse to help fight the Ebola outbreak in Monrovia when she got sick. She, too, is undergoing treatment.

A spokesperson for Samaritan's Purse said there have been riots outside the clinic.

Another doctor who has played a key role in fighting the outbreak in Sierra Leone, Dr. Sheik Humarr Kahn, is sick. He is being treated by the French aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres --also known as Doctors Without Borders -- in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, according to a representative of that agency.

Kahn had been overseeing treatment of Ebola patients in isolation units at Kenema Government Hospital, which is about 185 miles (298 kilometers) east of the capital, Freetown.

Sierra Leone's minister of health and sanitation called the doctor a national hero for the sacrifices he has made in trying to stop the outbreak.

Doctors and medical staff are particularly vulnerable to the virus because it spreads through exposure to bodily fluids from the infected. It can also spread through contact with an object contaminated by an infected person's bodily fluids.

The disease is not contagious until symptoms appear. Symptoms of Ebola include fever, fatigue and headaches. They can appear two to 21 days after infection, meaning many who are sick don't know it.

The early symptoms then can progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function, and sometimes internal and external bleeding.

Leaders in the international health community characterize the Ebola epidemic as the "deadliest ever."

While the World Health Organization has mobilized to fight the epidemic, it can be a difficult one to stop. It is so highly infectious that it typically kills 90% of those who catch it. The death rate in this particular outbreak had dropped to roughly 60% since it has been treated early in many cases. There is, however, no Ebola vaccination.

Is it time to test experimental vaccines?

With the announcement that Liberia is closing its borders, the country also instituted a new travel policy to inspect and test all outgoing and incoming passengers. The hope is that such measures will stop the spread of the virus.

There has never been a confirmed case of Ebola spreading to a developed country, said Kamiliny Kalahne, an epidemiologist with Doctors Without Borders.

"This is because people generally transmit the infection when they are very sick, have a high fever and a lot of symptoms -- and in these situations, they don't travel.

"And even if they do get sick once they travel to a developed country, they will be in a good hospital with good infection control, so they are very unlikely to infect others," she said.

"This is not the great plague," CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said after his trip to the region in the spring. "But it is a pretty formidable killer."

"The grim reality is it often kills so quickly, people don't have time to spread it."

The CDC held a media briefing Monday to emphasize the fact that there is "no significant risk in the U.S." for an Ebola outbreak. CDC officials said with the spread of Ebola to U.S. health care workers, there is a real need for "vigilance" to make sure workers are careful, get tested if there is any suspicion of illness, and that all sick travelers should remain isolated when returning from areas affected directly by the epidemic.

Stephan Monroe, CDC's deputy director of the National Center for Emerging & Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, said the CDC is working with American health care providers to educate them about Ebola. The agency sent a notice Monday to remind doctors to take important steps to avoid the spread of the illness, including asking their patients about their travel history, particularly if they have traveled to West Africa in the last three weeks.

Watch: Dr. Gupta dispels Ebola myths
(CNN)Marco Rubio is all in.  The Republican senator from Florida has announced that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the American Dream.

With his youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it's tempting to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016.  Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.  He holds little appeal to Latino voters.  And unless he can offer new ideas, his climb to the Republican nomination will be steep.

Back in 2013, Rubio was a member of the Senate "Gang of 8" that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.  He later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from House Republicans, and now says he favors a piecemeal approach, starting with securing the border.

His retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates.  That's a shame, for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to Latino voters.

Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.   He believes that President Obama's Deferred Action program, offering deportation relief to young immigrants, should be ended.  He has stated that the President's executive action on immigration, on hold pending a circuit court review, sets a "horrifying precedent."

Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.  No wonder the research firm Latino Decisions reports that, "We find no evidence that Rubio's candidacy will draw significant Latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally."  So, if Rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow Hispanics, he is mistaken.

At a private breakfast Monday for supporters, Rubio described running against "one candidate in the race who's from yesterday, and one who wants to take us back to yesterday."  But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.  Over the weekend, he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous.

He has warned that Cuba is taking advantage of the United States.  Here, he is an increasingly lonely voice.  Most Americans support better relations with Cuba, as do a majority of Cuban-Americans.  By clinging to the notion that isolating Cuba is better than engaging with the communist country, Rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership.

Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.  He is a fierce opponent of "Obamacare" and wants the law repealed.  However, the Affordable Care Act has led to a 12.3% drop in the Hispanic uninsured rate, making Latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance, thanks to the law.  (In fact, Rubio signed his own family up for "Obamacare" on the Washington exchange, taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers.)

Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.  And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue.

Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.  But his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding, Rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate.  In February, he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website Politico.

Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals.  Consider that his fellow contender for the GOP presidential nomination, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has been willing to present new ideas to the Republican base, such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana.  Or that another GOP candidate for president, Sen. Ted Cruz  of Texas is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand.  By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters.

With his early leap into the 2016 race, Marco Rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of GOP leadership.  Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.
(CNN) -- Thirteen Boston deputy fire chiefs have signed a letter of "no confidence" in Fire Chief Steve Abraira regarding his handling of the Boston Marathon bombings, according to the letter, which CNN independently obtained from a deputy chief who signed it but requested anonymity.

The deputy chiefs wrote of their displeasure to Boston Mayor Thomas Menino on April 26, according to the letter.

"You can unequivocally consider this letter a vote of no confidence in Chief Abraira," the deputy chiefs wrote in the letter. They said the chief failed to assume command responsibility or show any leadership at the scene.

"Despite the fact that the members of the BFD command staff have become accustomed to this 'ghost fire chief,' nothing prepared us for his actions, actually inactions, on the day of the horrific terrorist attack at the Boston Marathon," the letter reads.

"At a time when the City of Boston needed every first responder to take decisive action, Chief Abraira failed to get involved in operational decision-making or show any leadership," the letter continues.

In the letter, the deputies describe an e-mail that Abraira sent to all department members, saying that when he arrived at the scene, "it was clear that our Command Officer had the incident well in hand and that our department was fully active in a support role with our law enforcement partners."

The deputies call Abraira's argument "illogical" and "mere rationalization to justify his behavior," saying that when Abraira arrived, the Boston Fire Department was "still heavily involved in the incident" because of the possibility of "second explosions," "additional suspicious packages" and "structural stability concern of buildings," among other issues.

But Abraira defended his actions to CNN.

"In their estimation, they believe that if you don't assume command, you don't have responsibility there for what goes on," he said. "I tried to explain to them, if I'm on the scene, I'm still responsible. That's it. But they don't believe it."

Boston's top cop asked if bombing was preventable

The chief told The Boston Globe that he was comfortable with the way his commanders were handling the incident.

"The nationally accepted practice is that you only take command (as chief) if there's something going wrong or if you can strengthen the command position or if it's overwhelming for the incident commander, and none of those things were in fact happening," he told the paper.

The president of the Boston City Council, Steve Murphy, told CNN Wednesday that he was at the finish line shortly after the bombings and "personally I didn't see anything but selfless heroic acts on the part of the fire, EMT and police personnel."

But Murphy added, "if all 13 of our district chiefs are expressing no confidence then that concerns me." He said if the mayor did not act in response to the letter that the City Council, which funds the fire department, would look into the functioning of fire department command during upcoming budget discussions.

The twin blasts at the end of the Boston Marathon on April 15 killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. Six people remained hospitalized Wednesday, according to a CNN count.

One of two bombing suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died after a gunfight with authorities four days later. After much secrecy and protest, he was buried in a rural Virginia cemetery this month.

To locals' surprise, Tamerlan Tsarnaev buried in Virginia cemetery

Police took his brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, into custody on April 19 after finding him hiding in a boat in the backyard of a Watertown, Massachusetts, home.

He has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction and malicious destruction of property causing death.

Tsarnaev is being held at Federal Medical Center Devens.

Las Vegas (CNN) -- Police are on an "intense" and "extremely focused" nationwide manhunt for the occupants of a black Range Rover at the center of a shooting on the Las Vegas Strip that claimed three lives.

The incident involved a Maserati that was shot at and subsequently crashed into a taxi, which caught fire.

The driver of the Maserati, whom family identified as Kenneth Cherry Jr., died at a hospital. The taxi driver and a passenger also died.

The shots were fired from the Range Rover, which Las Vegas police spokesman Bill Cassell said could be anywhere.

Police have received multiple reports of vehicles that match the description, but "at this point, we have no information that the vehicle in the crime has been located," he said Friday.

Cassell declined to say whether there was one suspect or several, citing the ongoing investigation.

Cherry, an aspiring rapper known as Kenny Clutch, was driving his Maserati on Thursday when someone in the Range Rover fired several shots at his car as it headed north on Las Vegas Boulevard.

The Maserati continued into the intersection of the boulevard and Flamingo Road and collided with a taxi, which caught fire, killing cab driver Michael Boldon, 62, CNN affiliate KVVU said.

"It is gut-wrenching," Boldon's younger brother, Tehran Boldon, tearfully told KVVU. "My life mission will be to see them punished and brought to justice for the senseless thing they did."

In a separate interview Friday with CNN, Tehran Boldon said that his brother's son is a limousine driver on the Las Vegas Strip and he called his father to warn him to avoid the area after seeing a car afire -- not realizing that the taxi on fire belonged to his father.

"He saw the accident and he tried to warn his dad to say avoid Flamingo (Road)" because he knew his father was nearby at the Rio casino, Tehran Boldon said. "He called and he didn't get a response. So his father was the fatality in that accident that he was being warned to avoid.

"We lost a real patriarch and brother," said Tehran Boldon.

The son, 36, works the same shift as his father did. The father's body was burned beyond recognition and was identified by his cab assignment, Tehran Boldon said. He is also trying to provide the coroner's office with his brother's dental records, he said.

A passenger in the taxi also died. A passenger in the Maserati and three others were injured in the pileup, Sheriff Douglas Gillespie said.

The Clark County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner was conducting an autopsy of Cherry, 27, a representative said Friday. The office wasn't releasing further information Friday about Boldon or his passenger.

The fire closed a block and a half of the Strip near some of its biggest draws: Caesars Palace, the Bellagio, Bally's and the Flamingo. Police collected surveillance video from the casinos.

The shooting took place two blocks from where rapper Tupac Shakur was killed in 1996.

Cherry prominently features his Maserati in a music video on YouTube.

"Out of everyone I know in the rapping industry, there is no way I would have ever, ever expected to find that he was shot on the Las Vegas Strip in such an aggressive manner," said Vicki Greco, Cherry's attorney. "He didn't have a (criminal) record or a history. He was just a good kid trying to make it and be a good father."

Cherry had two children, she said.

"First time in Vegas, and then, like, the whole thing, what you know from movies only -- I was shocked," said Christine Gerstenberger, who was visiting from Germany.

Thursday's incident started about 4:20 a.m. with a dispute in the valet lot of the Aria hotel, about a block away, Gillespie said. Investigators haven't confirmed the cause of the altercation, but he said it spilled onto the street.

The Maserati's passenger and other witnesses are helping detectives piece together what happened, he said. The "top priority" for police is to find those who were inside the Range Rover, which sped away from the intersection.

John Lamb, who was inside Caesars Palace, told CNN affiliate KLAS that he heard the commotion and saw the taxi on fire from a window.

"There was a loud bang, and I heard two other booms. I looked out my window at Caesars Palace ... and could see the fireball," he told KLAS.

(CNN) -- For Kei Nishikori, "Project 45" has transformed into "Project 10."

The former was the 23-year-old's mission to topple the highest tennis ranking ever held by a Japanese male, Shuzo Matsuoka, who hit world No. 46 back in July 1992.

Nishikori smashed through that particular barrier towards the end of 2011 and has enjoyed a formidable few years on Tour, beating the likes of Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.

Japan's rising son now sits in the lofty position of world No. 11 -- his highest ever ranking -- and is tantalizingly poised to gatecrash the top 10.

But with success comes expectation.

This surge towards the game's pinnacle has elevated Nishikori to rock star-like status in his home country, its population clamoring for their first ever grand slam champion.

"I try not to think too much because if I start thinking then I feel pressure myself," Nishikori told CNN's Human to Hero series.

"I think people have started thinking about me winning a grand slam or getting to the top ten but it might take some time.

"I sometimes feel the pressure from a lot of things -- my team, my country, my fans -- but you have to handle it well.

"My next goal is to win a grand slam. Hopefully I can do it someday."

Shot maker

A first major could be around the corner if famed tennis coach Nick Bollettieri is to be believed.

Nishikori left Japan for Bollettieri's Florida academy aged just 13 without a grasp of English, but the intensive work on his game bore fruit within five years as he lifted his first ATP Tour title in Delray Beach.

According to the man who has coached a phalanx of the game's greats like Andre Agassi, Monica Seles, Boris Becker and the Williams sisters, Nishikori is "a shot maker."

Bollettieri told CNN. "When he's on, he can beat anybody in the world."

Djokovic and Federer can testify to that.

Both victories served as proof Nishikori has what it takes to prosper at the game's top table.

Career landmarks

In 2012 he became the first Japanese player to reach the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in 80 years and then went on to win the Japan Open -- the first home-grown talent to do so in the tournament's 41-year history.

He may have lost to eventual champion Rafael Nadal in the fourth round at this year's French Open, but he was the first Japanese player to get to that stage since 1938.

Nishikori clearly relishes testing himself against the best players of what is widely regarded as a golden generation.

"I love to play against the top ten guys," he said. "Beating Roger this year and beating Djokovic two years ago -- that is why I am playing tennis, to play those top 10 guys and to beat them.

"I still haven't beat Rafael Nadal or Andy Murray, there are more challenges to come to play those guys."

At world No. 11 he is the highest ranked Asian male player by a distance -- the next in line is Yen-Hsun Lu from Chinese Tapei in 60th -- and Nishikori wants to blaze a trail like Li Na who won China's first ever grand slam at the women's French Open in 2011.

"I am trying to get to be the most successful player in Asia," Nishikori added. "In tennis not many players get to the top 10 -- I think only a few in the past.

"It's still weird for me to think I'm the number one player in Asia, because when I was young I couldn't think I'd be the number one player in Japan or even Asia.

"But now I am and I have to receive it in my mind, my dream is coming and hopefully I can go further. I think Li Na did a great job. Hopefully I can be the first one to lead the young guys."

Fed hero

Nishikori still refers to Federer, whose elegance while accumulating his 17 major titles has seen him described as the greatest the game has ever seen, as his idol.

No wonder then that Nishikori joked he'd need a couple of days to celebrate after achieving one of his career goals by beating the Swiss at the Madrid Masters in May.

Federer's dominance of men's tennis was ingrained by the time Nishikori turned professional, but prior to that it was Matsuoka he was desperate to emulate.

"I have two heroes," he explained. "The first one is Shuzo Matsuoka, he was the first (successful Japanese player) -- he was the best tennis player in Japan.

"And Roger Federer. Still now, even though I love to see him play I think he is really the champion of tennis history."

'Project 45'

Nishikori's rise saw a swell of optimism that he could be a pioneer for tennis, hence the 'Project 45' hype as he edged towards usurping Matsuoka's ranking.

"Project 45 was no pressure for me -- I was just playing tennis for my hobby," he said.

"My first goal after turning pro was to get into the top 100 and after to be 45. It was one of my goals to be number one tennis player in Japan, and now I am ranked No. 11 in the world.

"To get to the top 10 is my next goal. It's not going to be easy to get there -- hopefully this year -- but I am getting close."

Rock star status

Like Matsuoka, Nishikori has come to understand what being Japan's sole representative inside the top 120 means -- fame and adoration.

Much like Andy Murray who has had to carry the hopes of the United Kingdom on his shoulders, Nishikori has the same weight of responsibility, but answers to double the amount of people.

"I go back to Japan about three or four times a year," he explained. "I get to go back to my home town and, yes, people do recognize me on the streets.

"It's not easy sometimes; you don't get to relax but at the same time I still try to enjoy the moment. Not many people can feel that way -- I love to stay in Japan, I really enjoy it when I go back."

Not for a second does he begrudge the accoutrements that his success in the game has delivered. He's just a boy made good from Shimane acting out his hobby on the global stage.

"For me, playing tennis was always my hobby, I am a lucky guy," he said.

"It was something I loved. It is something that can make you mad or crazy sometimes but it is something you love and not many guys can do your job.

"I try to enjoy this moment and this life -- it is not going to be a long time, 10 to 20 years, so I'm going to work hard."
It's been a cruel irony for ancient mariners and any thirsty person who has ever gazed upon a sparkling blue ocean: Water, water everywhere, and not a drop to drink.

But imagine a coastal city of the future, say in 2035. Along with basic infrastructure such as a port, roads, sewer lines and an electrical grid, it's increasingly likely this city by the sea will contain a newer feature.

A desalination plant.

Thanks to improved technology, turning ocean water into freshwater is becoming more economically feasible. And a looming global water crisis may make it crucial to the planet's future.

The United Nations predicts that by 2025, two-thirds of the world's population will suffer water shortages, especially in the developing world and the parched Middle East. Scientists say climate change is making the problem worse. Even in the United States, demand for water in drought-ravaged California and the desert Southwest is outpacing supply.

This is why a huge desalination plant is under construction in Carlsbad, California, some 30 miles north of San Diego. When completed in 2016, it will be the largest such facility in the Western Hemisphere and create 50 million gallons of freshwater a day.

"Whenever a drought exacerbates freshwater supplies in California, people tend to look toward the ocean for an answer," said Jennifer Bowles, executive director of the California-based Water Education Foundation. "It is, after all, a seemingly inexhaustible supply."

A growing trend

Most desalination technology follows one of two methods: distillation through thermal energy or the use of membranes to filter salt from water.

In the distillation process, saltwater is heated to produce water vapor, which is then condensed and collected as freshwater. The other method employs reverse osmosis to pump seawater through semi-permeable membranes -- paper-like filters with microscopic holes -- that trap the salt while allowing freshwater molecules to pass through. The remaining salty water is then pumped back into the ocean.

Officials at the Carlsbad plant say they can covert two gallons of seawater into one gallon of freshwater by filtering out 99.9% of the salt.

There are some 16,000 desalination plants on the planet, and their numbers are rising. The amount of desalted water produced around the world has more than tripled since 2000, according to the Center for Inland Desalination Systems at the University of Texas at El Paso.

"Desalination is growing in arid regions," said Tom Davis, director of the center. "We are making progress in the USA, but the countries around the Persian Gulf are way ahead in the use of desalination, primarily because they have no alternative supplies of freshwater."

Israel, in an arid region with a coastline on the Mediterranean, meets half its freshwater needs through desalination. Australia, Algeria, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also rely heavily on the ocean for their municipal water.

In the United States, desalination projects are concentrated in coastal states such as California, Florida and Texas.

Some environmentalists are wary of desalination, which consumes large amounts of energy, produces greenhouse gases and kills vital marine organisms that are sucked into intake pipes.

But proponents believe the technology offers a long-term, sustainable solution to the globe's water shortages. One entrepreneur has even built an experimental solar desalination plant in California's San Joaquin Valley.

"When other freshwater sources are depleted, desalination will be our best choice," said Davis, a UTEP professor of engineering.

California dreaming

Within the United States, the water crisis is especially severe in California, which has been stricken by drought over the last three years.

California's biggest source of freshwater is the snow that falls in the Sierras and other mountains, where it slowly melts into creeks and makes its way into aquifers and reservoirs. But if the planet continues to grow warmer, snow will increasingly fall as rain and will be harder to collect because it will swell creeks faster and create more flooding, said Bowles of the Water Education Foundation.

Seventeen desalination plants are being built or planned along the state's 840-mile coastline. City officials in Santa Barbara recently voted to reactivate their desalination plant, which was built in 1991 but shut after heavy rains filled nearby reservoirs in the early 1990s. Another $200 million facility has been proposed for the Bay Area, although construction won't likely begin for several years.

"The key question with ocean desalination is how much are you willing to pay for it? The amount of energy required to desalt ocean water can be daunting," said Bowles, adding that operating costs at the Santa Barbara plant alone are estimated at $5 million per year.

But advocates believe the price of desalination will continue to decrease as the process improves. This will be true of the massive Carlsbad plant, said Bob Yamada, water resources manager with the San Diego County Water Authority.

"The cost for this water will be about double what it costs us to import water into San Diego," Yamada said. "However, over time we expect that the cost of desalinated water will equal, and be less than, the cost of imported water. That may take 15 or 20 years, but we expect that to occur."

Ultimately, experts say, municipalities will need to balance desalination projects with conservation and water from more traditional sources, such as rivers, reservoirs and recycled wastewater.

"You can't get all your water from one source and have that source be hundreds of miles away," said Peter MacLaggan, senior vice president at Poseidon Resources Corporation, which is leading development of the Carlsbad plant.

"When and if the drought does come, and you don't have enough snowpack in the Sierras -- after 12 dry years the Rockies are seeing the impact of that today -- you've got (water) sources here within the boundaries of San Diego County," he said.

"We have a $190 billion economy in this region. It's dependent on water to sustain that economy. So the question you need to consider, is 'What's the cost of not having enough water?'"

Drought-ravaged California turns to tech for help
Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia are the blind husband and wife team from Mali who first gained widespread international attention in 2005 with their album "Dimanche a Bamako".

Amadou and Mariam have made the crossover to find international pop success.

After writing and performing together since they met at Institute of Young Blind of Bamako in 1977, their international break-through came when world music heavyweight Manu Chao produced their commercial hit album.

With a more pop-friendly sound but with the couple's positive and mesmeric vocals and Bagayoko's guitar playing, the duo have been feted by musicians across the world; the played opening sets for the Scissor Sisters and will be the opening act for Coldplay on their latest tour.

Having made the transition from world music to international pop sensations the couple talk to African Voices about their journey through music, coping with the setback of blindness and how their careers are on a high over 30 years after they began singing.

Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Supporters and members of the gay and lesbian community in Kenya blasted the country's prime minister Monday after he said anyone engaging in homosexual activity should be arrested.

"The gay community is very scared as the Prime Minister's statement will incite more violence against visible gays," David Kuria, a spokesperson for the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya told CNN.

Prime Minister Raila Odinga made the comments Sunday while attending a rally in the Kibera neighborhood of Nairobi.

"The constitution is very clear on this issue and men or women found engaging in homosexuality will not be spared," Odinga said during the rally. "If we find a man engaging in homosexuality or a woman in lesbianism, we'll arrest them and put them in jail," Odinga said.

Homosexuality is a crime in Kenya and has a jail term of up to 14 years. The country's new constitution disallows same-sex unions.

Gay rights have been a source of contention in Kenya in the past. In February an armed group raided a government health center that provides HIV/AIDS services to the community. The group insisted they were trying to "flush out the gays," according to a Human Rights Watch report.

A spokesperson of the prime minister's office, Dennis Onyango told CNN that the comments made by Odinga were off the cuff and were not a directive to arrest anyone. Kuria said the comments triggered state-sponsored homophobia.

"All the years of hard work we've done to curtail intimidation, violence and blackmail towards homosexuals has now been adversely reversed," said Kuria.

Lawrence Mute of the Kenya National Human Rights Commission says that the prime minister's comments unwisely encourage hate crimes based on assumed sexuality.

"Under the bill of rights, people should be treated equally regardless of their sexual orientation," Mute said.

President Barack Obama delivered a poignant personal promise to the American people Monday, vowing to continue to fight to improve racial tensions in America, given the "particular experiences" he brings to the office.

"I'm going to stay on this," the President said Monday in an interview with BET, a network that reaches a predominately young African-American audience. "Not only am I going to stay on it ... but hopefully the entire society says, 'Let's finally try to make some real progress on this.'"

Once criticized for shying away from the topic of race early on in his presidency, Obama has recently taken a more active role in sharing how his personal experiences help him to empathize with all kinds of people affected by the recent protests on racial tensions -- from protesters, to victims, to law enforcement officers, to families, and most importantly, to black youth.

In his interview with BET's "106 & Park," the President cited a meeting he had with nonviolent protesters Monday -- between ages 18-25.  For him, he says, listening to young African-Americans describe their own experiences of being stopped for no reason, or being unjustly labeled as suspicious, strikes a personal chord.

"My mind went back to what it was like for me when I was 17, 18, 20," the President said. "As I told them, not only do I hear the pain and frustration of being subjected to that kind of constant suspicion, part of the reason I got into politics was to figure out how can I bridge some of those gaps and understandings so that the larger country understands this is not just a black problem or a brown problem, this is an American problem."

The President also made a point to invoke Attorney General Eric Holder's race and civil rights record, saying, "He's got a similar set of stories and experiences he can share."

While most of the protests across the country have been relatively peaceful, many of the gatherings have caused traffic delays and street closures. According the President, those are small prices to pay in order to achieve the larger goal of ending racial tensions in America.

"A country's conscience sometimes has to be triggered by some inconvenience," the President said. "As long as they're peaceful, I think they're necessary. When they turn violent then they're counter-productive."

As he noted in the first half of his interview, teased Sunday, the clear video evidence available in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, a black man, in Staten Island in July has helped the broader public come to believe there are racial inequalities in the criminal justice system in a way the shooting death of Michael Brown, also black, in Ferguson, Missouri, in August, did not. In both cases, grand juries failed to indict the white police officers responsible for their deaths.

"It used to be folks would say, 'Well, maybe blacks are exaggerating. Some of these situations aren't what they describe,'" Obama said. "What we've now seen on television -- now for everybody to see -- gives us the opportunity to finally have the conversation, that you know, has been a long time coming."

The President will be interviewed by both Univision and Telemundo on Tuesday, both of which are networks that target primarily Latino audiences.

In his interview Monday, Obama suggested that people who aren't "African-American or Latino" view the deaths of both Michael Ferguson and Eric Garner as "tragedies."
(CNN) -- Jebb Graff isn't turned off -- yet -- by Carnival Cruise Lines' recent troubles.

Graff took a seven-day cruise last fall on the Carnival Fantasy to Grand Turk, Half Moon Cay and Nassau, Bahamas and had a wonderful time. "It was a fantastic trip," wrote Graff, a photographer in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina, in an email.

"A few veteran cruisers grumbled about the age of the ship, and the decor being dated, but the service and experience was really great," he said.

Graff said he would definitely take another Carnival cruise. But he has some conditions.

"There's no question that Carnival should be seriously looking into their maintenance policies and double-checking their work to make sure their customers and crews are having the safest voyages possible," wrote Graff. "If these issues continue to go on unchecked, then I'll change my answer."

Carnival cruise line in more troubled waters

Carnival has a window of opportunity to convince customers its ships can sail without too much trouble, according to several travel agents and cruisers interviewed by CNN.com. But the company has to prove it is tackling the recent spate of mechanical issues faced by four Carnival ships, the most serious of which left more than 4,000 people stranded for days aboard the Carnival Triumph last month.

'A grace period' to fix things

Carnival has a grace period of a couple months to get its act together, according to travel agent Ricci Zukerman. Her mostly high-end clients occasionally book a more budget-oriented Carnival cruise for a family reunion or when they're bringing teenagers along because "they're the fun ships," she said.

"Carnival has been in business for many years, and for a long time there's never been a hitch," said Zukerman, president of Worldview Travel. But they need to attend to their maintenance issues. "If it happens again, I think people will start worrying. There are other ships in the ocean," although none quite so affordable, she said.

Carnival Cruise Lines announced a "comprehensive review" this week of all its ships, prompted by the engine fire that led to the Triumph's stranding in the Gulf of Mexico in February.

As the biggest cruise company in the world, parent company Carnival Corp. has a strong reputation in the industry and among its regular customers, said Kimberly Wilson Wetty, co-president of Valerie Wilson Travel.

In addition to Carnival Cruise Lines, the corporation's portfolio includes brands such as Holland America Line, Princess Cruises, Seabourn, Cunard and Costa Cruises. The Costa Concordia had a deadly accident off the coast of Italy last year.

Five things we've learned about cruising

Overall advance bookings are down

Total advance bookings across all of Carnival Corp.'s brands for 2013 are behind 2012 levels, Carnival said in a news release Friday announcing first quarter financial results. But despite the overall lag, booking volume since January for the rest of the year has been "running significantly higher than last year at slightly higher prices," the company said.

"Despite considerable attention surrounding the Carnival Triumph, we had been encouraged to see booking volumes for Carnival Cruise Lines recover significantly in recent weeks," said Micky Arison, chief executive officer of Carnival Corp.

"All ships experience some challenges," said Wetty, who traditionally books her customers on high-end cruises. "It's all the recovery and how they treat the passengers and how they continue to build consumer confidence.

"For those who are consistent cruisers and know Carnival, I don't think it's going to change their buying habits. For new cruisers, it puts a little doubt in their minds. "

Not every frequent Carnival cruiser is feeling so confident.

"I have cruised with Carnival on many occasions with my family. They were my [favorite] cruise line. That being said, I will stay on land from here on out," wrote one CNN.com commenter.

"Until they have a really really long period of time with no problems I will not consider cruising with them again. This is just way too much. The Concordia going down was bad enough, but all of these are just plain nonsense. It WILL hurt the cruise line."

Customers need to be reassured Carnival is doing everything it can to address its ships' issues, Wetty said.

How Carnival can clean up the PR mess

Customers of canceled cruises complain

Current customers, some of whom have been posting on CNN.com, are having trouble reaching the company in some cases.

"What about those of us that got our cruise canceled?" wrote one commenter, who said she was scheduled to sail on the Carnival Dream. "I haven't heard anything from Carnival, and I don't know how long it will take to get a refund. Now we are stuck not knowing what to do for a vacation we saved 8 years to take!"

Still, Connie Hammond is one of those Carnival fans who isn't giving up on the cruise line.

"All three of my prior Carnival cruises were wonderful, food was outstanding, ports were well organized and safe, shipboard activities were plentiful, all for a small budget price," Hammond, a resident of Fort Madison, Iowa, wrote in an e-mail.

"I'm sure I could have paid $1,000 more per person and been impressed much more, but the Carnival cruise was a great vacation and a memorable fun time."

Hammond said she expects the recent incidents will be a wake-up call for Carnival's maintenance program, but she's not concerned about safety.

She's already booked her next Carnival cruise, taking her 79-year-old mother and a girlfriend who has never been on a cruise.

After a bad cruise, can you cruise into court?
(CNN)In the gentle yet fiercely warm surrounds of the southern Ugandan countryside, Mwanja Banuli looks on as farmhands fill his truck with sugar cane.

Packing this rough, woody crop is heavy going and making sure every inch of space is utilized is key.

Transport costs money, after all, and this humble sugar farmer has lots of costs to consider.

"There are many challenges in this business," Banuli says. "Rent for our land costs about $300 and then you need to pay people to clear the land.

"You have to hire a tractor for ploughing and tilling the land. When you add up all these expenses, it's a big investment."

Searching for Sugarman

In Uganda, sugar is big business.

This particular batch is headed for Kakira Sugar Limited -- one of the country's oldest and largest factories.

Kakira was founded by Muljibai Madhvani, an immigrant from the Indian subcontinent in the late 1920s.

It's a company still going strong to this day.

"What you see in the background is the first mill that was installed in 1930 to crush only 150 tons of cane," explains Kenneth Barungi, assistant general manager of Kakira at the site of the company's nearby factory.

"(Kakira) started expanding every 10 years, every 20 years, modernizing, acquiring more land, introducing irrigation, expanding the crushing capacity. By (the 1970s) they were producing about 83,000 tons of sugar."

"That was about 50% of all the sugar produced in Uganda. At that time they (Kakira) contributed to about 53% of the national GDP... just because of manufacturing and industry," he added.

Dawn of dictatorship

It was at this time, however, that history intervened in the shape of one of the 20th century's most brutal rulers.

After a military coup in 1971, army commander Idi Amin Dada seized power. The former heavyweight boxer made himself Uganda's president and a brutal dictatorship followed.

The often erratic Amin praised Hitler and said the German dictator "was right to burn six million Jews." He even bizarrely offered to be king of Scotland if asked.

Within a year he had expelled the country's Asian population, numbering around 35,000.

After almost 50 years, the Madhvanis were no longer welcome in Uganda.

Those who stayed, did so at their own risk.

"When Idi Amin told every Asian to leave, they all left the country and went mainly to the UK," Barungi continued, adding that he believes this when Uganda began to economically fall apart.

"All industries collapsed, all international trade collapsed. There was no longer available foreign exchange to import machinery. Even if you imported the machinery you didn't have technical expertise here to run such industries."

"Within a few years Kakira Sugar Industries had collapsed, but so had infrastructure in Uganda. Social services, everything had collapsed."

A new start

After Idi Amin was deposed in 1979, however, some of the ejected population slowly started coming back to Uganda.

Among the returnees were the Madhvanis. The country they left behind, however, was a very different place.

"The factory was a skeleton," Barungi said. "There was no longer a sugar plantation, the houses were occupied by anybody. There was no business to run so it (the plantation) was just an empty shell."

The Madhvanis quickly borrowed money from the World Bank and the African Development Bank and set about rebuilding their business.

It has grown rapidly over the last 25 years and now produces 18,000 tons of sugar (a year), Barungi said.

But the effects of the macabre, harrowing events of recent history still linger.

A sweeter deal?

Some reports suggest some black Ugandan workers resented how certain sections of the Indian mercantile class treated them.

These days, however, Kakira says it strives to promote a responsible philosophy for how it interacts with its workers.

Not only is this the right way to engage with people in its employ, they believe, it also improves productivity and staff mobility.

Kakira has built schools and hospitals to cater for their staff and their families while the company has also founded the Kakira Outgrowers Rural Development Fund (KORD), an NGO that provides the likes of workshops, loans and other services for its contractors.

Besides nearly 8,000 staff members, Kakira has almost as many contract workers in the shape of farmers, like Mwanja Banuli.

They farm the lands neighboring the plantations and are contracted to Kakira, supplying 70% of its sugarcane needs.

"To be able to sustain business you want agricultural farmers, plantation workers, you want factory workers and the vision of Muljibhai Mudhvani was to develop human resources," Barungi said.

This enlightened approach saw KORD awarded with a best NGO-business partnership award from the Ugandan Manufacturers Association.

But it's the positive impact on individual lives that offers the biggest reward for many in the community.

"Before KORD I was just useless," said Beatrice Katende, who has received assistance from the body's programs. "I used to work as a casual laborer for other people in the community digging in their gardens to get some income.

"When KORD came into existence we learned to farm, to save and how to be self-sufficient."

Through offering a hand up to people like Katende, Kakira hope to help themselves as well as provide assistance to other areas of the local economy.

"The main vision was to always make sure that there is labor supply always available to work at the factory. The excess can go and work in other industries in the country," Barungi said.

(CNN) -- Last week Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas officially submitted the statehood request asking that the United Nations recognize "Palestine" as an independent state.

But while Abbas's raising of the document during his speech drew applause at the General Assembly, the United States has already promised it will veto the Palestinian statehood bid at a Security Council meeting Monday.

Why is this move happening now?

The Palestinian Authority leadership says they are making the request for statehood now for a few reasons. Firstly, they argue that over the course of the past two years the Palestinian Authority has made great progress in building the infrastructure necessary for maintaining a sovereign state. They point to the various improvements in governance, security, and physical infrastructure as indicators of their readiness.

Palestinians also point to the September 2011 date that U.S. President Barack Obama laid out over a year ago as the deadline for the successful negotiation with Israel for a two-state solution. The Quartet of Middle East peace, made up of the U.N., European Union, Russia, and the U.S. also set this month as the target date for a negotiated deal. With that deadline not having been met Palestinian leaders argue that that the best way to enhance the chances for peace moving forward is for international recognition of a Palestinian state.

Who is agreeing with the Palestinians' demand, and who is disagreeing?

In the 15-member Security Council, the one body that can confer full U.N. membership, the Palestinians enjoy the support of a majority of the countries. But the United States, which as one of the five permanent members holds veto power, has pledged it will vote down the statehood bid, ending the Palestinians' chance to win full membership.

In the General Assembly, where a vote would be non-binding, the Palestinians enjoy the support of more than 120 of the 193 members and passage of a statehood resolution would be all but assured.

Why do the U.S. and Israel oppose the call?

Both the U.S. and Israel consider the Palestinian strategy a unilateral move that will only hinder the possibility of reaching a peaceful settlement to the Middle East conflict. U.N. action, both countries argue, does not take the place of direct negotiations. Speaking recently to reporters, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said: "We believe strongly that the road to peace and two states living side by side does not go through New York, it goes through Jerusalem and Ramallah."

Israel calls for peace talks amid Palestinian statehood push

Surely, if the U.S and Israel don't agree then it won't mean any difference on the ground?

Without the acknowledgement of Israel and the U.S., United Nations recognition of a Palestinian state based on armistice lines that existed before 1967 is largely a symbolic move. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected these lines as the basis for a Palestinian state, calling them "indefensible." Therefore the borders, airspace, and movement of people in a new "Palestine" would continue to be controlled by the Israeli military and it would be unlikely to change the presence of about 300,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank.

If a Palestinian state is recognized, what could that mean for relations/negotiations with Israel?

Many believe recognition of a Palestinian state would exacerbate already poor relations between the Palestinian Authority government and Israel. Some politicians in Israel have called for unilateral responses to the Palestinian bid including the outright annexation of territory in the West Bank, the withholding of tax revenue collected on behalf of the Palestinians, and the cancellation of various parts of the 1993 Oslo accords that created the Palestinian Authority. Potential moves like this and what some believe could be a rising level of Palestinian frustration at unmet expectations could add a great deal of tension on the ground and contribute to the possibility of an outbreak of violence. Palestinian Authority leadership maintains that recognition would help put pressure on Israel to be more reasonable in future negotiations.

Is there risk in this move for the Palestinian Authority?

Beyond the potential response from Israel, the Palestinian bid at the U.N. is risky. The U.S. is opposed to the move and lawmakers in congress have threatened to pull the plug on hundreds of millions of dollars in annual American aid. Others say the move will unrealistically raise expectations of Palestinians and, if little actually changes on the ground, could contribute to regional tensions. The Palestinian Authority could also risk losing support from its own people. The Hamas political faction, which controls Gaza, does not support the U.N. strategy and there are concerns among the Palestinian refugees in the region that the statehood bid could compromise their "right of return" to their homeland.

Would U.N. recognition give the Palestinians anything substantive?

Recognition by the United Nations could potentially give Palestinians greater access to international bodies like the International Criminal Court and the Human Rights Council. Venues like these could serve as a place for Palestinians to file legal challenges to Israeli practices and exert more international pressure on Israel.

What's the current state of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians?

Currently there are no talks going on between Israeli and Palestinians. Talks fell apart a year ago over disagreements on the issue of Israeli West Bank settlements. Coming off a self-imposed 10-month halt in settlement construction, Israel said it would not renew the freeze. This led the Palestinians to quit the negotiations. In an effort to head off the Palestinian's statehood request at the U.N. the United States and various European countries have been engaged in 11th hour diplomacy to get the talks restarted but few expect a breakthrough deal.
A common benchmark in the United States for determining when a driver is legally drunk is not doing enough to prevent alcohol-related crashes that kill about 10,000 people each year and should be made more restrictive, transportation safety investigators say.

The National Transportation Safety Board recommended on Tuesday that all 50 states adopt a blood-alcohol content (BAC) cutoff of 0.05 compared to the 0.08 standard on the books today and used by law enforcement and the courts to prosecute drunk driving.

"Most Americans think that we've solved the problem of impaired driving, but in fact, it's still a national epidemic," NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said.

The idea for a tighter standard is part of a safety board initiative outlined in a staff report and approved by the panel to eventually eliminate drunk driving, which accounts for about a third of all road deaths in the United States.

NTSB looks to technology to end drunken driving in the U.S.

Hersman said progress has been made over the years to reduce drunk driving, including a range of federal and state policies, tougher law enforcement, and stronger advocacy. But she said too many people are still dying on America's roads.

The board acknowledged that there was "no silver bullet," but that more action is needed at the federal and state levels.

"In the last 30 years, more than 440,000 people have perished in this country due to alcohol-impaired driving. What will be our legacy 30 years from now?" Hersman asked. "If we don't tackle alcohol-impaired driving now, when will we find the will to do so?"

Lowering the rate to 0.05 would save about 500 to 800 lives annually, the safety board  said.

Under current law, a 180-pound male typically will hit the 0.08 threshold after four drinks over an hour, according to an online blood alcohol calculator published by the University of Oklahoma. That same person could reach the 0.05 threshold after two to three drinks over the same period, according to the calculator.

Supreme Court rules against police in drunk driving case

Many factors besides gender and weight influence a person's blood alcohol content, and many states outlaw lower levels of inebriation when behind the wheel.

The NTSB investigates transportation accidents and advocates on safety issues. It cannot impose its will through regulation and can only recommend changes to federal and state agencies or legislatures, including Congress.

But the independent agency is influential on matters of public safety and its decisions can spur action from like-minded legislators and transportation agencies nationwide. States set their own BAC standards.

The board also recommended on Tuesday that states vastly expand laws allowing police to swiftly confiscate licenses from drivers who exceed the blood alcohol limits.

And it is pushing for laws requiring all first-time offenders to have ignition locking devices that prevent cars from starting until breath samples are analyzed.

In the early 1980s, when grass-roots safety groups brought attention to drunk driving, many states required a 0.15 BAC rate to demonstrated intoxication.

But over the next 24 years, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other groups pushed states to adopt the 0.08 BAC standard, the last state falling in line in 2004.

The number of alcohol-related highway fatalities, meanwhile, dropped from 20,000 in 1980 to 9,878 in 2011, the NTSB said.

Drunk-drive blood tests divide Supreme Court

In recent years, about 31 percent of all fatal highway accidents were attributed to alcohol impairment, the NTSB said.

"I think .05 is going to come. How long it takes to get there, we don't know. But it will happen,"   said the NTSB's Robert Molloy, who helped guide the staff report.

For some, the vote struck close to home.

NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt noted that one of his relatives had been killed by a drunk driver and another is serving a 15-year sentence in a related death.

Many of the recommendations "are going to be unpopular," Sumwalt said. "But if we keep doing what we're doing, we're not going to make any difference."

The NTSB cited research that showed most drivers experience a decline in both cognitive and visual functions with a BAC of 0.05.

Currently, more than 100 countries on six continents have BAC limits set at 0.05 or lower, the safety board said.

The NTSB has asked all 50 states to do the same.

CDC: Teen drinking and driving rates cut in half

A restaurant trade association, the American Beverage Institute, attacked the main recommendation, saying the average woman reaches 0.05 percent BAC after consuming one drink. The group said it based that conclusion on a chart it said was used by auto safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

But NHTSA told CNN on Tuesday it no longer uses that chart "as there are many variables" that contribute to an individual's level of intoxication. A new NHTSA chart shows a person with a 0.05 BAC level experiences "reduced coordination, reduced ability to track moving objects, difficulty steering, (and) reduced response to emergency driving situations."

A beer industry trade group said it would examine NTSB's recommendation for lowering the blood-alcohol threshold.

"However, we strongly encourage policymakers to direct their efforts where we know we can get results: by focusing on repeat offenders and increasing penalties on those with BAC of (0.15) or more," said Joe McClain, president of the Beer Institute.

The safety board also recommend that NHTSA provide financial incentives to states to carry out the changes.

NHTSA, which oversees highway safety as a federal regulator and analyzes traffic crash data, said it would work with any state that wants to pursue a lower BAC standard to "gather further information on that approach."

At Tuesday's meeting, the safety board also championed laws allowing police to confiscate a motorist's license at the time of arrest if the driver exceeds a BAC limit, or refuses to take the BAC test.

Some 40 states already use the administrative tool, which the NTSB believes is effective because it is swift and immediate.

And the board recommended more widespread use of passive alcohol sensors, which police can use to "sniff" the air during a traffic stop to determine the presence of alcohol.

The sensor is capable of detecting alcohol even in cases where the driver has attempted to disguise his breathe with gum or mints.  If the sensor alerts, it is grounds for more thorough testing.

The NTSB recommended last December that states require ignition interlocks for all DUI offenders and said states should improve interlock compliance.

Tuesday's recommendations were timed to coincide with the deadliest alcohol-related crash in U.S. history.  On May 14, 1988, a drunk driver drove his pickup the wrong way on Interstate 71 near Carrollton, Kentucky.  The truck hit a school bus, killing 24 children and three adults. More than 30 others were hurt.

If you've rolled up your sleeves and gotten experience, tell potential employers when applying for a job.

Talk to a dozen students on any college campus and you're likely to hear a dozen different perspectives on what they hope to get out of college. Some want high GPAs; some want to get into the work force and earn a lot of money.

Ask their parents and you'll get just as many different answers. Some parents hope that their children earn their degree and have an easy time finding a job. Others want them to be at the top of the class so they can get into the best graduate school possible. And some just want their children to stop partying long enough to attend class once in a while.

Ask employers what they want from graduates and the answers are equally diverse. Depending on the job, you might need a degree and an internship, a degree and work experience, or the right connections to even land an interview.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly 39 million Americans over the age of 18 have a bachelor's degree. Considering that 281 million people live in the country, college graduates are still a small percentage of the population.

Still, with a number in the millions, you are competing with a lot of job seekers who also have the same educational background as you. Relying only on your bachelor's to land a job is not the safest route to employment. As with most things, it's all in the presentation.

Degree or not, presentation matters

Sue Chehrenegar studied biology as an undergraduate and biomedical research as a graduate student. During her job search, she found herself losing out on job opportunities because she lacked the proper experience, despite her education. Or so she thought.

"At the end of the 1980s, I spent more than one year looking for a job," she remembers. "I kept getting this question: 'Have you done anything in the area of molecular biology?'" She would tell employers that she didn't have the proper experience because she wasn't specifically trained for that.

"I did not mention the fact that I once assisted a graduate student who was putting DNA and RNA into cultured cells."

What does that mean in layman's terms? Because her specialization and the bulk of her experience was not in this particular field, she didn't consider the limited work with the graduate student worth mentioning. She later realized employers weren't looking for someone to be the ultimate authority on the subject; they wanted someone who had a broad range of knowledge.

"I realized my mistake more than two years after I got a job," Chehrenegar remembers.

"My first year I worked in an infectious disease lab. Later, they put me in a molecular biology lab. When I helped with one of the projects in that lab, I realized that my old, unmentioned experience related to what I was doing at that time."

A degree isn't useless

Sure, if you're applying for a job with bio- as a prefix, you know a degree is a requirement. But for less research-intensive jobs, you might think a degree can always be supplanted by enough experience. Depending on your occupation, that could be true but isn't a hard and fast rule for all positions.

For example, you might be able to find work at a museum, but you the odds of you transitioning into a curator can be extremely difficult without extensive education in art history and related courses. You could find that you hit a ceiling in an organization.

Although this bodes well for graduates who come armed with one or more degrees, it also means that workers in this industry have the opportunity to earn an education while they ascend the corporate ladder. In some cases, the combination of their experience and a recently awarded degree could be more impressive if you've relied on your degree and haven't diversified your experience.

How to present yourself

Here are some tips to keep in mind when presenting yourself to employers:

• Even though you know education isn't the single factor in getting hired, it is often a prerequisite to land an interview. Don't hide your degree just because you have a lot of experience -- you don't want to lose out on an interview because your education was overlooked.

• Use all of your education to your advantage. Connect the job requirements to any courses you took, whether as an elective or part of your minor. You might not have loved that statistics course, but if it's relevant to the job, mention it.

• Treat work experience and internships as proof that you're a professional, not just a student. If you speak as if you see yourself as a student who doesn't consider himself or herself as part of the working world, the employer might not either.

Washington (CNN)A year after ISIS became a household name in America, using brutality and savvy propaganda to challenge al Qaeda and its affiliates for jihadist adherents, U.S. prosecutions of would-be recruits have exploded.

The flurry of arrests -- at least 25 people have been detained since January -- is a sign that complicated, manpower-intensive investigations begun when ISIS started seizing swaths of territory a year ago are finally being completed.

But they also highlight the unique challenges that ISIS poses in comparison with al Qaeda, which has attracted fewer U.S.-based recruits.

Like a new rock band storming the music charts, ISIS has benefited from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda, law enforcement officials said. The group quickly reached early recruits through videos that showcased the fear its adherents instilled in nonbelievers.

At first, most of the recruits were self-starters -- people radicalized on their own from consuming ISIS propaganda from YouTube videos and other social media. Much of the propaganda comes in the form of slick movie trailer-style videos, some glorifying brutal practices such as the beheading of anyone who ISIS leaders decide doesn't comport with their medieval brand of Islam.

But once those initial Western recruits arrived, living in the self-declared ISIS caliphate spanning parts of Syria and Iraq, they started to directly entice friends and other contacts back home to join them.

In Minnesota, nine men have been charged as part of an alleged cell of recruits linked to American Abdi Nur, who turned up fighting with ISIS in Syria in 2014 and began to appeal to his friends to come to the Middle East.

"Each one of those folks who makes it over there has the capability to reach out back to their contacts back here," a senior U.S. counterterrorism official said.

It's a phenomenon observed in Norway and other European nations, where clusters of young people have been lured to ISIS.

And the ISIS recruiters have an easier path to drawing supporters than al Qaeda has had. A decade ago, that group's recruits faced formidable obstacles trying to get to training camps deep in hard-to-reach areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal region. Few Westerners went through the trouble.

Minneapolis men allegedly trying to join ISIS highlight role of American recruiter

Today, ISIS occupies much more accessible territory, mostly reachable through Turkey. Istanbul's airport has easy connections to Western Europe and much of the rest of the world. From there, Turkey's modern infrastructure offers quick access to the border regions where smugglers can help jihadis get across to Syria.

The informal recruitment networks and ease of travel have presented a difficult puzzle to intelligence and counterterrorism officials, who are used to tracking networks of facilitators and fundraisers that funnel recruits eastward.

"It's harder for us to pick up on," the U.S. counterterrorism official said of the peer-to-peer recruitment, which is well below the radar.

How ISIS is luring Westerners

Before ISIS, investigators could often focus on radicalizing mosques and clerics to figure out those networks.

Al Qaeda recruitment focused on attracting radicals who were motivated to join the fight to protect Islamic holy lands. Much of the recruitment occurred in countries with strong conservative Islamic histories, including Saudi Arabia and Yemen, U.S. officials said.

In contrast, ISIS takes a somewhat secular approach, portraying how much better life purportedly is in the caliphate as compared to the corrupt West. And people attracted to ISIS' marketing run the gamut from rich to poor, educated to dropout, male to female, teenaged to middle-aged.

There are signs Western recruits have risen to high levels in the ISIS organization, with their influence reflected in the latest propaganda, counterterrorism and intelligence officials said. The English is proper, with fewer grammatical and spelling mistakes.

And while the large number of arrests show that law enforcement officials are succeeding in their disruption efforts, it also means that U.S. authorities don't see the lure of ISIS receding any time soon.

"We are opening cases quicker than we are closing them," the U.S. counterterrorism official said.

Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West?
Washington (CNN) -- Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., once a rising Democratic star whose political fortunes imploded over the use of campaign finances to support lavish personal spending, was sentenced to 30 months in prison on Wednesday.

"I misled the American people," Jackson, 48, said before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson imposed the term, which also included an order for restitution and community service.

The ex-Illinois lawmaker's wife, Sandi, received a 12-month sentence for her role in her husband's misuse of roughly $750,000 in campaign funds over several years.

"I don't have to tell you this is a very sad day and a very difficult case," Judge Jackson said, calling it an example of organized and joint misconduct and a violation of the public trust.

"You knew better," she said.

As the judge read her sentence, Sandi Jackson wept. Her husband smiled slightly when he received his punishment, which was less than what the government sought.

The pair pleaded guilty in February to various charges -- Jackson to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, and false statements; and his wife to filing false tax returns.

After the hearing, Jackson acknowledged his failings and hoped for a renewal.

"I still, believe in the power of forgiveness. I believe in the power of redemption. Today I manned up and tried to accept responsibility for the error of my ways," he said before climbing into a waiting vehicle.

Vacations, furs and memorabilia

A smooth politician and the son of a civil rights leader and one-time political heavyweight, the younger Jackson admitted to using campaign money to pay for things such as vacations, furs and Michael Jackson memorabilia.

In a statement read in court, Jackson said he wanted to be held accountable for his actions and he knew what he did was wrong.

He also asked the judge to not punish his wife for what he said "was a subset of what I did."

"I ask that my kids not suffer from my actions," Jackson said of his two children, 9 and 13. "If probation is not available to my wife, give me her time."

Jackson's lawyers reiterated that sentiment and asked the court for an 18-month sentence for Jackson and probation for his wife.

"This is not Madoff," Reid Weingarten, Jackson's lawyer, said in court, referring to notorious Wall Street swindler Bernie Madoff. "There was no Ponzi scheme."

Sandi Jackson sobbed through part of her courtroom statement and said she "put her family unit in peril" for filing false tax returns.

"I stand before you today asking for mercy," she said. "My heart breaks every day with the pain it's caused my babies. I ask the court for mercy."

Prosecutors had sought a four-year sentence for Jackson and 18 months in jail and restitution of $168,550 for his wife.

"This is a sad day that involves a waste of talent," prosecutor Matthew Graves said. "They were in the top 10 percent of household earnings in the United States. There's just no need for this kind of conduct."

Graves said that Jackson did not "deserve credit" for his job as a congressman.

"That's what he was paid to do," he said.

Jackson's lawyers pointed to his record in Washington -- one they said was good -- in arguing for a lighter sentence.

The judge said the sentencing guidelines were excessive and that apologies expressed appeared genuine. She also cited helpful cooperation.

"The real remorse you've shown is palpable in this courtroom," she said. "There's no question you've suffered. Your remorse is real."

After sentencing, the judge gave the couple a few minutes to discuss who wanted to serve their sentence first.

Jackson will begin his sentence around November 1 at a prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, the judge said.

Jackson requested the location.

"I ask for Alabama so I can be as far away from everybody for a while as I can be," he said. "I want to make it a little inconvenient for everybody to get to me."

In addition to jail time, Jackson must repay in full the money he misused, while his wife was ordered to make restitution of $22,000.

Jackson and his wife also were ordered to perform community service.

Jackson in Congress until 2012

According to court records, Jackson misused about $750,000 in campaign funds from August 2005 through July 2012. Some of the eye-popping spending included $60,000 at Antiques of Nevada, where Jackson bought two hats belonging to the late singer Michael Jackson costing more than $8,000; a $5,000 football signed by U.S. presidents; and memorabilia involving the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and martial artist Bruce Lee.

The Jackson's also use campaign funds to purchase Blu-Ray DVD players from Best Buy, dresses and jewelry from a small boutique and fur capes and parkas from a Beverly Hills, California, furrier.

In total, prosecutors said Jackson made more than 3,000 purchases.

Jackson served in the House of Representatives from 1995 until 2012, when he took a medical leave of absence and never returned.

He was succeeded by Democratic Rep. Robin L. Kelly, who won a special election this year to fill the vacancy in the Illinois 2nd Congressional District.

Jackson's lawyers later stated he suffers from bipolar disorder.

A rising star, knows Obama

Early in his political career, Jackson was considered a politician on the rise.

In 1997, Newsweek named him one of the 100 people to watch in the next century.

"He's a hit in Congress," read the Newsweek article. "Will he be the first black president?"

Although Jackson never lived up to that hype, he was an extremely vocal supporter of then-candidate Barack Obama.

"I'm sure that Dr. King is looking down on us here in Denver noting this is the first political convention in history to take place within sight of a mountaintop," Jackson said in 2008, referencing the Rev. Martin Luther King's famous speech, "I've Been to the Mountaintop."

"I know Barack Obama," Jackson said. "I've seen his leadership at work. I've seen the difference he has made in the lives of people across Illinois."

Outside the courtroom, Jackson Sr. told reporters that his son was "unbelievably sick" a year ago, but is now doing better.

"I don't know how I missed so many signs," the elder Jackson said.

CNN's Carol Cratty, Athena Jones, and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of militants, believed to be foreign fighters, launched attacks on various military check posts in Pakistan's border with Afghanistan Saturday night and early Sunday morning, military officials said.

A Pakistan soldier on patrol last fall against militants on the border of the Mohmand agency district.

The ensuing fighting left 40 militants and six Pakistan soldiers dead, said military spokesman Gen. Athar Abbas.

"This is one of the largest attacks we have seen," Abbas said.

The attacks occurred at checkposts and military camps in the Mohmand agency, part of the lawless Federally Administered Tribal Areas where U.S. and Pakistani officials have reported a presence of militants.

Abbas said the fighters crossed into Pakistan from Afghanistan, and used rocket launchers and machine guns in their attacks. They have since been repelled, he said.

Pakistan and Afghanistan share a porous 1,500-mile border.

In recent months, Afghan officials have blamed militants operating from havens in the lawless tribal regions of Pakistan of sneaking into their country and attacking security personnel.

Pakistan has repeatedly denied involvement and bristled at the accusation, saying that Afghan lawmakers were making allegations without proof.

Abbas' Sunday comments reverse those allegations, with Pakistan now blaming militants from Afghanistan attacking inside its soil.
Gilbert Taylor, who gave the "Star Wars" films their sharp look as the cinematographer of 1977's "Star Wars," has died, according to Lucasfilm. He was 99.

Taylor died Friday at his home on the Isle of Wight, according to starwars.com.

"From the iconic opening shot of a massive Imperial Star Destroyer chasing the Rebels' Tantive IV to the setting of twin suns on Tatooine, Taylor played a large role in establishing the visual identity of the entire series," the website noted.

"Gilbert's work truly stands the test of time," said "Star Wars" mastermind George Lucas in a statement.

Taylor was already a well-established cinematographer when "Star Wars" came along. He oversaw the camerawork on three 1960s classics, Stanley Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" (1964); the Beatles' first film, "A Hard Day's Night" (1964); and Roman Polanski's "Repulsion" (1965). He was also the cinematographer for Alfred Hitchcock's 1972 thriller, "Frenzy."

"He was a true expert in his craft. Gilbert's inspired work will live on in the many films he contributed to throughout his long career," Lucas said.

Among Taylor's other credits are "The Omen" (1976), the 1979 version of "Dracula" and "The Bedroom Window" (1987).

People we've lost in 2013
Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Anders Behring Breivik's defense counsel had warned that the self-confessed killer would show no remorse. And that was clear from the start.

No sooner were his handcuffs removed in the than he raised his arm in a fascist-style salute -- a symbol, to quote his wordy manifesto, of "strength, power and defiance against Marxist tyrants."

He announced he did not believe in the authority of the Oslo court. His plea then followed: not guilty, though he acknowledged his acts. He claimed he was acting "from necessity."

Rampage suspect says he acted to save Norway

He sat in the court on the first day of the trial Monday wearing a suit, no handcuffs, no restraints, no cage as you might see in other countries -- not even for a mass murderer.

There were smiles and handshakes with the psychiatrists and prosecution at the start. The only barrier was bullet-proof glass between him and the family members, built to protect him rather than the other way around.

This is after all Norway, a country that prides itself on its liberal values. It is a country that has endeavored, as the Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg promised shortly after the attacks last year, to respond with "more openness, more democracy and more humanity" to these most inhuman of crimes which left 77 people dead.

And that is what they are doing -- taking pride in the fact they are a society who will respect Breivik's human rights, even when he showed no respect for the lives of others.

This is why Geir Lippestad, Breivik's defense lawyer, took on this most difficult of jobs. "I remember I woke up my wife, or she woke up by the same telephone call," he told reporters back in March.Â  "She's a nurse and she said 'if he had arrived at the hospital with gunshot wounds, the doctors and nurses would have helped him, they'd do their job.Â You are a lawyer, so don't you want to do your job?'"

"He was so close to having a bullet between his eyes, the police were so close," said Jorn Overby, who rescued 15 people from the waters off Utoya island on the fateful evening of July 22, 201.

When I press him about whether he felt that would have been the best thing for him, he replied: "I owe him a punch in the face for firing at me." But his desire for revenge stops there. "He will get the treatment he needs," he said.

These are people who would prefer never to have to speak Breivik's name again.

On the Dagbladet website you can now press a button to opt out of news relating to the deadly attacks. There is a sense the people of Norway want to see due process done and then move on. They are a people who believe their system works, which is why no matter how unspeakable his crimes and how hard these months are and will continue to be, Breivik has not been able to break them.
(CNN) -- "Star Wars" makeup artist Stuart Freeborn, who helped create Chewbacca, Yoda, Jabba the Hutt and the otherworldly creatures in the trilogy's famous barroom scene, has died, Lucasfilm said Wednesday.

He was 98.

A creature effects artist, Freeborn also worked on other film classics and was responsible for creating the apelike human ancestors in the "Dawn of Man" sequence in "2001: A Space Odyssey."

He also did the makeup for Peter Sellers in "Doctor Strangelove," Lucasfilm said on its starwars.com website.

"Stuart was already a makeup legend when he started on 'Star Wars,'" said George Lucas, creator of the films.

"He brought with him not only decades of experience, but boundless creative energy. His artistry and craftsmanship will live on forever in the characters he created. His 'Star Wars' creatures may be reinterpreted in new forms by new generations, but at their heart, they continue to be what Stuart created for the original films," Lucas said in a statement.

Playful, impish and imaginative, Freeborn played a pivotal role in developing the character Yoda for "The Empire Strikes Back."

Director Irvin Kershner said Freeborn put his own image into Yoda the Jedi Master, giving the character inquisitive and elfin features with "more than a passing resemblance to Freeborn himself," Lucasfilm said.

Freeborn also put his skills to work in "Oliver Twist," "The Bridge on the River Kwai," "The Omen," four "Superman" films, "Top Secret!" and "The Great Muppet Caper."

Among the more memorable sequences in the "Star Wars" film is the Mos Eisley Cantina, which Freeborn and his team populated by creating Greedo, Walrus Man and Snaggletooth.

He also worked on the tauntaun and wampa ice creatures in "The Empire Strikes Back."

"Return of the Jedi" is considered the "monster movie" of the trilogy, and Freeborn and his team in the United Kingdom developed Jabba the Hutt, which was a massive puppet, and the teddy-bear-like Ewoks.

He was often joined in his makeup work by wife Kay, who died last year, and son Graham, who died in 1996.

People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived
London (CNN) -- More than six decades ago, the European Movement's founder Jean Monnet shared his vision for the region's nascent union, prescribing money as a means to heal the wounds left by two world wars.

"The fusion" of Europe's economic ties, he said, would compel its nations "to fuse their sovereignty" as well "into that of a single European state."

To the Frenchman, a federal Europe was the natural progression of the bloc's newfound stability.

A collection of like-minded countries whose shared goals were so clear they would willingly surrender their own governments for the group's greater good.

That was 1952. A time when the future held great promise after the horrors of the past and anything seemed possible -- even creating a new pseudo country. A place now known as the European Union.

Fast forward to the present day and, though the EU does have some shared organs of government, like a commission and parliament, it certainly isn't the set of "united states" Monnet hoped for. Ones with the same deep-seated convictions and beliefs.

The glue holding their common ideologies together came unstuck with the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Since then, a crisis among countries sharing the euro has reopened old wounds. Ironically, instead of bringing nations together, their finances have threatened to tear them apart.

This leaves us with one fundamental question: if the EU's main task is no longer to provide peace, and it can't guarantee prosperity either, then what should its role be?

Born from the ashes of Europe's turbulent past, the EU has accomplished much for its members.

It has taught its citizens value of compromise over violence, providing protection and strength in numbers.

It has boosted prosperity, thanks to the free flow of goods and labor brought about by the single market, while consumer and workers' rights have been reinforced and their health improved thanks to bans on smoking.

But the EU has also drifted far from its original concept, its ranks swollen by a massive Brussels-based bureaucratic machine which, critics say, is stifling industry and is pushing members like the UK towards the exit door.

The bloc's borders have doubled with its endless absorption of former communist countries, stretching the definition of Europe to its limits, making membership to this formerly elite club appear more like a handy foreign policy tool rather than a cherished vision.

The EU faces a constant challenge living up to the expectations of its citizens and without two-tier policies it has no hope of serving both the bloc's strong and weak economies alike.

The EU needs a new vision a new project its people can feel passionate about.

And where better to start then this week's pivotal parliamentary elections.
